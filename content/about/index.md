Jinn is a paper fox wandering the suburban wilds of the Pacific Northwest. He howls at evil robot sorcerers with his skulk.

As an aspiring novelist, his current interests and areas of study include: The Renaissance and the Reformation in the 16th century... military tactics and technology (from early modern to present day)... and elements of the esoteric and occult, esp. the Tarot.

His favorite novels are _Cloud Atlas_ (2004), _Dune_ (1965), and _Ancillary Justice_ (2013). His favorite short story collections are _Interpreter of Maladies_ (1999), _Pump Six and Other Stories_ (2008), and _Tenth of December_ (2013). The trilogy, _His Dark Materials_ (1995-2000), is up there too.

IRL, Jinn is a marketing consultant based in Vancouver BC, a historical wargame & OSR enthusiast, and father to three monsters.
