Jinn is a paper fox wandering the suburban wilds of the Pacific Northwest. With his tight-knit skulk of weirdos, loners, and misfits... they howl in protest at evil robot sorcerers. 

As an aspiring novelist, his current interests and areas of study include: The Renaissance and the Reformation during the 16th century... military tactics and technology (from early modern to present day)... and elements of the esoteric and occult, esp. the Tarot.

His favorite novels are _Cloud Atlas_ (2004), _Dune_ (1965), and _Ancillary Justice_ (2013). His favorite short story collections are _Interpreter of Maladies_ (1999), _Pump Six and Other Stories_ (2008), and _Tenth of December_ (2013). The trilogy, _His Dark Materials_ (1995-2000), is high up there too.

Jinn is a founding member of the Garage Fiction Podcast.
