 1. Name a time you accidentally screwed up in a way that could potentially affect a lot of people, and then what steps you took to cover it up while you also (or had help) desperately trying to fix it (so that it looked like you never screwed up in the first place, and what's more -- there were a lot of rules/guardrails/lines you had to adhere to in order to maintain the facade.
 2. Name a time you had to go on a quest/job/mission but your host/boss/tour-guide in the unknown territory was incompetent, lacked self-awareness, lacked social/political awareness, or is a pariah in their own lands, or is generally a [HTHF](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/hthf/) (Hard-to-Help-Friend). Tell me about how they created obstacles and problems the entire trip, basically sabotaging you, but you overcame it and still got the McGuffin.
 3. Name a time you were imprisoned/trapped/involuntarily-stuck somewhere (maybe a job assigned to you, or you got partnered with a team, or whatever), and while it sucked at first, you made friends with your fellow prisoners, and in talking to them, you led them working together to get out, and even got petty vengeance on your warden.
 4. Name a time you impulsively took on a responsibility (new pet, new relationship, new hobby) because you thought it would be fun and  you didn't think of all the consequences that would come with it, you didn't fully realize what you were getting yourself into until it was too late, and how did you eventually fixed it? Did you get out of it, did you drop it, did you return it, did you "accidentally lose it", did you find it a new home?
 5. Name a time a new rival showed up in your life, unexpectedly at an event, and this rival is impressing/seducing your crush/spouse/child/best-friend/boss/someone-important-to-you, so you act all crazy and out-of-character, and then when none of those things work, you start following/stalking/staking-out this rival, and you find out they're not who everone thinks they are, they're actually even better (or actually worse), and you're proven right/wrong, and now you have to confront that.
 6. Name a time you got someone overeager to help you take care of something that's inconvenient or annoying to you, and it's great at first because you're actually making progress and getting new gains, and this whole annoying part of your life is gone, but then, because you're no longer doing this "boring routine" thing you used to do, there are unexpected consequences, and now your dependence on this ally is a problem, worse, they start or offer to help out in other areas of your life, and you need to break free. How did you eventually give up this "free help"?
 7. Name a time you had to do/get X, and all the obstacles were "Not as They Seem" [NATS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/nats/) forcing you to question all your beliefs/values/worldview.
 8. Name a time when you have TWO+ important people in your life, both needing your time/energy/resources, but you only have enough for one, so you try to get them together because you think a two-for-one approach actually works in my brain, but really, it just ends up being awkward as fuck. But then -- something happpens that makes them best friends forever, and now you feel abandoned by these two. How did it turn out? Was there a new equilibrium, or you ended up the third wheel, or?
 9. Name a time you had to deal with a malcontent ([MCNT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/mcnt) and nothing you did was right, or made them happy, or caused more problems (according to them), or the method was wrong. What was your breaking point when you finally said "no" and stopped helping them?
 10. Name a time when you got sucked into a reward system (with vanity metrics) with the promise of this nebulous, abstract ultimate reward (something everyone wants, like power, wealth, fame, looks, whatever), so you keep doing it and levelling up, and everything feels so right, until you get a peek behind the curtain (or finally come to your senses), and you realize how big of a scam (or a lifelong commitment with a exhorbitantly high cost where you sacrifice all the good things life has to offer). How did you get out?
 11. Name a time you got kicked out of your own home/work/comfort-zone/routine by a intimidating force (basically a bully), and you had to go on the run and/or find a new home, but nothing seems to fit, everything is wrong, until you finally do find a new home that's potentially better, and you're happy only for the bully to show up again, and you realize you just have to fight the bully. And you do. And the bully finally shows you respect for standing up for yourself.
 12. Name a time when you went to a new community and you see that they're all doing a weird routine/habit/hobby/practice/ritual, and it's stipid and causes all these unintended side effects and problems and externalities (and the community would be better if only they stop doing this thing), but because everyone's doing it, their world adopted to this stupid new way of doing things, and eventually, even your best friend (or people who stood by you in rebelling against this stupid new thing) is _also_ doing it, and you feel betrayed, but you finally succumb and do the stupid thing just so you join this community. OR, you don't succumb and you remain the outcast, or change-you-want-to-see, and you eventually convince one or two people to leave this community.
 13. Name a time where you or a friend had to do a very simple rituatlistic thing that maintains civility (apologize, thank you, acknowledgement), but refused, and the person who wants this basic civil thing has a lot more power than you thought, and now they're bringing all that power to bear and being petty and making the person-who-refused's life miserable, and yet the person-who-refused continues to suffer and not do this basic thing out of principle, won't swallow their pride... UNTIL it hurts the people they love.
