 1. Name a time you accidentally screwed up in a way that could potentially affect a lot of people, and then what steps you took to cover it up while you also (or had help) desperately trying to fix it (so that it looked like you never screwed up in the first place, and what's more -- there were a lot of rules/guardrails/lines you had to adhere to in order to maintain the facade.
 2. Name a time you had to go on a quest/job/mission but your host/boss/tour-guide in the unknown territory was incompetent, lacked self-awareness, lacked social/political awareness, or is a pariah in their own lands, or is generally a HTHF (Hard-to-Help-Friend). Tell me about how they created obstacles and problems the entire trip, basically sabotaging you, but you overcame it and still got the McGuffin.
 3. Name a time you were imprisoned/trapped/involuntarily-stuck somewhere (maybe a job assigned to you, or you got partnered with a team, or whatever), and while it sucked at first, you made friends with your fellow prisoners, and in talking to them, you led them working together to get out, and even got petty vengeance on your warden.
 4. Name a time you impulsively took on a responsibility (new pet, new relationship, new hobby) because you thought it would be fun and  you didn't think of all the consequences that would come with it, you didn't fully realize what you were getting yourself into until it was too late, and how did you eventually fixed it? Did you get out of it, did you drop it, did you return it, did you "accidentally lose it", did you find it a new home?
 5. Name a time a new rival showed up in your life, unexpectedly at an event, and this rival is impressing/seducing your crush/spouse/child/best-friend/boss/someone-important-to-you, so you act all crazy and out-of-character, and then when none of those things work, you start following/stalking/staking-out this rival, and you find out they're not who everone thinks they are, they're actually even better (or actually worse), and you're proven right/wrong, and now you have to confront that.
 6. Name a time you got someone overeager to help you take care of something that's inconvenient or annoying to you, and it's great at first because you're actually making progress and getting new gains, and this whole annoying part of your life is gone, but then, because you're no longer doing this "boring routine" thing you used to do, there are unexpected consequences, and now your dependence on this ally is a problem, worse, they start or offer to help out in other areas of your life, and you need to break free. How did you eventually give up this "free help"?
 7. Name a time you had to do/get X, and all the obstacles were "Not as They Seem" (NATS) forcing you to question all your beliefs/values/worldview.
