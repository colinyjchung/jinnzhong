In memory’s cottage we did attend  
imbibing sorrows, wind and ghosts to list  
and o, the well worn masks no longer lend  
nor show a face to meet other faces  
we had but tears, regrets and love to share  
we talked as if it was our very last  
besides, the beast within we’d once endear  
that was our hungry youth laid now in waste  
we spoke to each our journey and the paths  
we’d chose, the dreams we’d chase fulfilled or not  
ambitions pursued but contained in wrath  
intentions proposed but elsewhere we got  
  and it seemed as if we’d live our full  
  but deep inside I felt it all was null
