## GAME/TURN: G01/T01, December 23rd, 1944 - Night

### Chit, Supply, & Initiative

    * 11A/7D, +1 DE night, +1 Hvy. -2 US town = 1-1 CRT/0 DRM, d10=2(0) = D/-, Pzr. Lehr disrupted.

    * 7A/7D, +1 DE night, -2 US town = 1-1 CRT/-1 DRM, d10=8(7) = -/R, 84th retreats North to 2111, Pzr. Lehr advances into 2113 Rochefort.

## THOUGHTS on TURN ONE
Messed up a lot on the terrain effects table at first. Redid several moves for German AP1, and referred to the rules a lot. Took me a bit to fully grasp differences between towns (fixed MP cost) versus villages (variable MP cost depending on terrain). Rivers also threw me. 

Plus, motorized units have their own MP costs separate from infantry units.

Not seeing how I can maneuver to cut off supply lines as easy in this game. The ZOC requires a lot of linking up, and even then, you can "infiltrate" to break through the lines.

Forgot the US 2nd only has 6MP on turn one. So redid that move twice.

Nearly impossible for 84th to defend Rochefort if Panzer Lehr shows up. They rush North and assault from both sides. Well, I did as German player.

Also  (so many backtracks), I didn't realize the Pzr. Lehr chit was a recon unit. I had put it under the Pzr. Lehr 2-step chit thinking it was a step loss. In an alternate timeline, the 84th held Rochefort and was reinforced by another battalion using trucks to get there fast.

    * 17A/8D, -1 Village. 2-1 CRT/-1 DRM, d10=3(2) = no effect.

## Thoughts on Turn Two
Don't know why I took the initiative as Allies even though I knew they had only 2 action phases to the German's 3 AP this turn. I think I just wanted to shore up my defenses and ZOCs. Turned out well for the Allies.

Allies pulled multiple tactical chits. The air attack was useful. The extra move allowed the 2nd arm to destroy the 2nd Pzr. recon hanging near Buissonville.

I had two goals for the Germans. Send some units to the Meuse river, as that's their objective for collecting VPs... but also start destroying the 84th, or at least break through their lines. Problem was, they (I) rolled terribly.

The Battle of Marloie was just absurd. Two waves from the 2nd Pzr. and effectively rolled "2" twice. I missed the fact that the second Pzr. unit I moved in was a SP/AT and not pure armor. But even so... the Germans are now positioned for a triple-wave attack at 29-14 (2-1 CRT). Still not the ratio I (as Germany) would've wanted though.

### Recovery & Victory Points
* Germans score 3VP for 3 units next to Meuse

## Thoughts on Turn Three
I made a huge mistake as allies by seeking vengeance after the German's first action phase. They took Marloie, they were exhausted, and there was one 2nd Panzer unit with a step loss. Figured two 84th infantry units could take it down. Bad rolls ensued. (Also, missed the rule exception that only three 84th units can be activated. d'oh.)

Obviously, when the 116th Panzer came up... they had to chew up the 84th. Which is what they did, with one eliminated and one retreating back to Marche.

On the German side, Panzer Lehr made a speed run towards the river Meuse. We got three units there, so 3VPs! The Allies did activate an extra move using 2nd Armor to hunt down a Panzer Lehr, but it was not enough. Also - I forgot I could activate a separate unit versus the formation indicated when I pull an action chit. I wouldn't have used the 4th Cavalry. They were useless.

It's devastating seeing Germany's 4APs vs Allie's 2APs and how much they could do. Well, tomorrow is Christmas and the Allies have 5APs to fix this huge mess.

### Recovery & Victory Points
* 0VPs for Germany as US 2nd Arm chased them away from Meuse river

## Thoughts on Turn Four
Well, that was a disappointing Christmas for the Allies. Yes, the 2nd Armor Division chased away all the Panzer Lehr units away from the Meuse river, denying them points. Yes, the 2nd Armor Division also fast-tracked to Marche and Marloie to reinforce the faltering 84th Infantry Division. And yes it was great when the 29th Armour (with a "u") Division eliminated a Panzer Lehr unit.

This is all very good news. But so many rolls only resulted in disrupting the Germans and not more. I thought the five action phases for the Allies compared to the German's three would create more devastating results. I'm learning that the CRT can be really rough if you don't have superior firepower... but that's a given too right? I mean, I took aggressive risks with 1-1 CRT rolls. I even took one with -3 DRM just so I could keep pressing forward.

And what is up with there being no 4-1 CRT? Lame.

It's Christmas night next and the Germans have 4APs to the Allies 3AP. Let's see what happens.
