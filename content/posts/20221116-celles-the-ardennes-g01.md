## GAME/TURN: G01/T01, December 23rd, 1944 - Night

### Chit, Supply, & Initiative
German has initiative by default

* German pulls 2nd Pzr Division.
* 2nd Pzr  recon unit in 2612 ➔ 2009 Buissonville for 12MP

* German pulls Panzer Lehr Division
* Pzr. Lehr bn in 2216 ➔ 2114 for 2MP + 9MP (H.Atk) against 84th bn  in 2113 Rochefort. 
    * 11A/7D, +1 DE night, +1 Hvy. -2 US town = 1-1 CRT/0 DRM, d10=2(0) = D/-, Pzr. Lehr disrupted.
* Pzr. Recon 2216 ➔ 2213 for 3.5MP + 6MP (M.Atk) against 84th bn in 2113 Rochefort. 
    * 7A/7D, +1 DE night, -2 US town = 1-1 CRT/-1 DRM, d10=8(7) = -/R, 84th retreats North to 2111, Pzr. Lehr advances into 2113 Rochefort.

## THOUGHTS on TURN ONE
Messed up a lot on the terrain effects table at first. Redid several moves for German AP1, and referred to the rules a lot. Took me a bit to fully grasp differences between towns (fixed MP cost) versus villages (variable MP cost depending on terrain). Rivers also threw me. 

Plus, motorized units have their own MP costs separate from infantry units.

Not seeing how I can maneuver to cut off supply lines as easy in this game. The ZOC requires a lot of linking up, and even then, you can "infiltrate" to break through the lines.

Forgot the US 2nd only has 6MP on turn one. So redid that move twice.

Nearly impossible for 84th to defend Rochefort if Panzer Lehr shows up. They rush North and assault from both sides. Well, I did as German player.

Also  (so many backtracks), I didn't realize the Pzr. Lehr chit was a recon unit. I had put it under the Pzr. Lehr 2-step chit thinking it was a step loss. In an alternate timeline, the 84th held Rochefort and was reinforced by another battalion using trucks to get there fast.

    * 17A/8D, -1 Village. 2-1 CRT/-1 DRM, d10=3(2) = no effect.

## Thoughts on Turn Two
Don't know why I took the initiative as Allies even though I knew they had only 2 action phases to the German's 3 AP this turn. I think I just wanted to shore up my defenses and ZOCs. Turned out well for the Allies.

Allies pulled multiple tactical chits. The air attack was useful. The extra move allowed the 2nd arm to destroy the 2nd Pzr. recon hanging near Buissonville.

I had two goals for the Germans. Send some units to the Meuse river, as that's their objective for collecting VPs... but also start destroying the 84th, or at least break through their lines. Problem was, they (I) rolled terribly.

The Battle of Marloie was just absurd. Two waves from the 2nd Pzr. and effectively rolled "2" twice. I missed the fact that the second Pzr. unit I moved in was a SP/AT and not pure armor. But even so... the Germans are now positioned for a triple-wave attack at 29-14 (2-1 CRT). Still not the ratio I (as Germany) would've wanted though.

### Recovery & Victory Points
* Germans score 3VP for 3 units next to Meuse

## Thoughts on Turn Three
I made a huge mistake as allies by seeking vengeance after the German's first action phase. They took Marloie, they were exhausted, and there was one 2nd Panzer unit with a step loss. Figured two 84th infantry units could take it down. Bad rolls ensued. (Also, missed the rule exception that only three 84th units can be activated. d'oh.)

Obviously, when the 116th Panzer came up... they had to chew up the 84th. Which is what they did, with one eliminated and one retreating back to Marche.

On the German side, Panzer Lehr made a speed run towards the river Meuse. We got three units there, so 3VPs! The Allies did activate an extra move using 2nd Armor to hunt down a Panzer Lehr, but it was not enough. Also - I forgot I could activate a separate unit versus the formation indicated when I pull an action chit. I wouldn't have used the 4th Cavalry. They were useless.

It's devastating seeing Germany's 4APs vs Allie's 2APs and how much they could do. Well, tomorrow is Christmas and the Allies have 5APs to fix this huge mess.

### Recovery & Victory Points
* 0VPs for Germany as US 2nd Arm chased them away from Meuse river

## Thoughts on Turn Four
Well, that was a disappointing Christmas for the Allies. Yes, the 2nd Armor Division chased away all the Panzer Lehr units away from the Meuse river, denying them points. Yes, the 2nd Armor Division also fast-tracked to Marche and Marloie to reinforce the faltering 84th Infantry Division. And yes it was great when the 29th Armour (with a "u") Division eliminated a Panzer Lehr unit.

This is all very good news. But so many rolls only resulted in disrupting the Germans and not more. I thought the five action phases for the Allies compared to the German's three would create more devastating results. I'm learning that the CRT can be really rough if you don't have superior firepower... but that's a given too right? I mean, I took aggressive risks with 1-1 CRT rolls. I even took one with -3 DRM just so I could keep pressing forward.

And what is up with there being no 4-1 CRT? Lame.

It's Christmas night next and the Germans have 4APs to the Allies 3AP. Let's see what happens.

* Germans score 2VP

## Thoughts on Turn 5

This was a rough turn for the Germans despite having the night advantage. I felt like I was shoring up my defenses the entire time. The 9th Pzr was helpful in filling in gaps. The 2nd Pzr was simply retreating. I didn't realize how devastating last turn actually was.
It takes getting used to, but disruption actually matters a lot for destroying troops. The US 2nd Armor almost feels OP with 15-12-9 stats. Up against any Panzer unit, it hits on the CRT at 3-2.

## Thoughts on Turn Six
Man, 4th Cav, British 29th Armour, and even 84th Infantry are all useless when you're on the attack. They're good for maneuvering and defending, but it's clear I would activate the US 2nd Armor over and over again in order to affect the board.
That Allies AP4 sucked though. Givet is across the river and a town, so that's -3DRM straight off. That attack was probably why I ended up with a tie maybe. With that said, the 2nd Armor sure killed a lot Nazis (Panzer Lehr and 9th Panzer).

## Thoughts on Turn 7
The Germans had to stop running scared from the US 2nd Armored, so the 9th Panzer coordinated a good attack and eliminated a unit. The 116th Panzer also did a great job of enlisting the Führerbegleitbrigade to lay siege in Hotton and destroy two 84th infantry units and the 3rd Armored.

Good turn for the Germans.

    * **GERMANS**: 17VP

## Thoughts on Turn Eight
Germans pulling FBB in the last turn and then getting airstruck is the worst of luck. It reduced the final turn to one measly move. Taking Rochefort made the most sense. But they couldn't defend it. Not with the Allies action economy.

Looking back the last few turns, I really needed the 116th Panzer to be activated more. They didn't do much after showing up.
