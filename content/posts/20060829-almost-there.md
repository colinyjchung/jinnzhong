Thank you for subscribing to my infrequent updates. 

Please check your inbox for an email with the subject line: **"Big Blue Button Inside".**

Click on that button to confirm you actually want my updates and you're not a homunculus sent by evil robot sorcerers.

Golems, servitors, and the undead need not apply either.

It's important you click on that **Big Blue Button**.

Clicking on that **Big Blue Button** will bring you a stroke of serendipitous luck, unfathomable wealth, and true love. 

I can promise you this because my father added an extra, unnecessary "n" to my Chinese name, which makes me an honorary jinn. شبيك لبيك!

(Not really).

But you really should... 

1. Go to your inbox, _right now_.
2. Look for the email with the subject line: **"Big Blue Button Inside".**
3. Open said email, and click on the **Big Blue Button**

If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder.

Nothing else you do in the next few moments is more important.

Nothing!

Yours,

Jinn Zhong
