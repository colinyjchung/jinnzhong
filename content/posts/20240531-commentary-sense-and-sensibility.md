The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _Sense and Sensibility_ (1811) by Jane Austen. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. 

:warning: **SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** (_obviously_). :warning:

* V1ch1 - that was a lot of background to get through and keep track of. Let‚Äôs LIFO this because it‚Äôs confusing af otherwise. Daughters are Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret. Mom is Mrs. Henry Dashwood. Mr. Dashwood inherited Norland Park from ‚ÄúThe Gentleman‚Äù but both ded. Problem is Mr. Henry Dashwood has a son from a previous marriage, Mr. John Dashwood, who obviously inherits Norland Park, because male and firstborn‚Ä¶ so, now the three daughters are in a precarious situation much like the five Bennet daughters. Oh and Mrs. John Dashwood is a bitch and doesn't want her husband to take care of his three half-sisters and keep all the money for their son, Harry.
* V1ch2 - oh ok. John is a fucking idiot and Fanny is manipulative.
* v1ch3 - Edward Ferrar has no ambition, no artistic taste. Sounds like a fun guy. 
* v1ch6 - another cold hearted woman in Lady Middleton. What‚Äôs going on here? I feel like the foreshadowing here is that the Dashwood women are going to get screwed throughout this book.
* v1ch7 - Mrs Jennings is a busybody and Marianne is a teenager that doesn‚Äôt like anything and is openly critical of it. I feel like I‚Äôm taking notes not just to keep track of characters. Can‚Äôt wait until I hit up Dostoevsky. Hear that‚Äôs super fun because everyone has five names.
* v1ch8 - is the Allenham lady a witch? wtf. She gets one paragraph and disappears. What are you doing Austen. I see you.
* Willoughby the Hunter from Allenham‚Ä¶ who are you?
* Hahaha. This was the most female/male convo ever. Marianne: ok, but what is he like if you‚Äôre friends? Sir John: I dunno. He‚Äôs a good hunter and has a black dog. I like him.
* Thought. Edward Ferrar would be a  25yo streamer living in his parents‚Äô basement today.
* V1ch10 - are they just talking about favorite books and music???
* ok. So Elinor Dashwood & Edward Ferrar. Marianne Dashwood & Colonel Brandon/Mr. Willoughby
* ‚ÄòBrandon is just the kind of man whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to.‚Äô Ouch
* Is Brandon this book‚Äôs Darcy?
* v1ch11 - so weird they‚Äôre trying to understand a teenager. They are ineffable. But also, is the name Brandon won‚Äôt say Lady Middleton?
* V1ch12 - A freeeee‚Ä¶ HORSE!!!! You get a horse, and you get a horse, and you get a horse! 
* Poor Margaret. Got no social game.
* v1ch13 - JFC‚Ä¶ leave the guy alone. Can you not have bad news and keep it private in this time? Or are they being assholes by asking nonstop? Ooooh. Secret daughter. Dammit. I got sucked into Jenning‚Äôs rumor mill. Fuck.
* V1ch14 - willoughby is getting on my nerves. He‚Äôs also creeping me out. 
* v1ch15 - interesting, interesting. Both Colonel Barton and Willoughby both had to leave urgently. Barton is discreet despite everyone asking to know his sitch‚Ä¶ whereas Willoughby runs his mouth on anything and everything‚Ä¶ and has this weird bundle of super suss excuses? I dunno.
* V1ch16 - Band Name: Sulky Teenage Girl Breakup. Or Sulky Girl Teenage Breakup. Even did the lashing out at the Middletons. Just missing ice cream.
* V1ch19 - ‚ÄòHere comes Marianne,‚Äô cried Sir John. ‚ÄòNow, Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.‚Äô Uh‚Ä¶ this is extremely odd behavior. Does Sir John see the Dashwoods as zoo animals to be presented? I get a sense the Palmers are here to kick them out of the cottage as well? 
* ‚ÄòHow horrid all this is!‚Äô said [Mr. Palmer]. ‚ÄòSuch weather makes every thing and every body disgusting. Dulness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain. It makes one detest all one‚Äôs acquaintance. What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house? How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the weather.‚Äô  ROFL. This guy. 
* In a dark and depraved version of S&S, Sir John is a trafficker of underaged girls and all his wares are ‚Äúmonstrous pretty creatures‚Äù
* v1ch. 21 - of course the Middleton children are spoiled and unruly. Of course
* V1Ch. 22 - secret four year engagement!!!! What!
* ‚ÄòHe was tired, I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.‚Äô Sorry/not sorry. üòè 
* v2ch1 - so much of Austen‚Äôs scene PROGs are simply the PROT navigating a social setting to get a chance to speak to someone in private with proper excuses. 
* Coxcomb - a man who is too proud of his appearance
* Play Name: Waiting for Willoughby
* v2ch5 - why doesn‚Äôt colonel Brandon just marry Elinor? I mean , Edward Ferrars is out of the picture now right? Haha. Just try another sister!
* v2ch6 - Play Name Sequel. Ghosted by Willoughby.
* V2ch7 - Play Name Three-quel. Thirsty Marianne.
* So what‚Äôs going on here? did Willoughby and Ferrar go to Barton to slum and see if they could seduce the Dashwoods for fun?
* v2ch9 - holy mother fucking hell this just got reeeeaaaallll. Eliza. Little Eliza. Littlest Eliza. Willoughby love child. And Colonel Brandon helpless to it all. Fuuuuuuuuck.
* v2ch10 - somehow I don‚Äôt believe these people would actually cut ties with Willoughby. Tribes stick to their tribes and Dashwoods ain‚Äôt part of this tribe. But Sir John‚Äôs indignation is hilarious considering my point on being the stereotypical male making friends.
* I‚Äôm sorry, but Lucy Steele is a porn star name.
* v2ch11 - is Elinor pawning stuff? And Edward is engaged to a Morton? What? 
* Sedulous - Persevering and constant in effort or application; assiduous.
* Phillipic- 1. Any of the discourses of Demosthenes against Philip II of Macedon, defending the liberty of Athens. 2. Any tirade or declamation full of bitter condemnation. ‚Ä¶ Austen, your education is showing. sorry, shewing.
* pg. 237. Ok listen. I‚Äôm high right now. Is Jane Austen talking to me? Where the fuck did this ‚ÄúI‚Äù come from?
* pg. 248. Ok I‚Äôm not high anymore. So can anyone please explain why Elinor is now talking to me in the first person?
* v3ch3 - I mean, at one point, you have to admit that Mrs. Jennings has basically kidnapped the Dashwoods and/or are holding them hostage if they‚Äôre constantly politely told they can‚Äôt go home‚Ä¶
* pg. 272 - hey, can you pass on this generous gift to your ex for me?
* v3ch7 - is Marianne going to die? And I also don‚Äôt care? This book. And omg, why hasn‚Äôt colonel Brandon and Elinor gotten a room yet. It‚Äôs so obvious those two are going to end up together. 
* v3ch8 - let me interrupt you and force my explanations on you even though you don‚Äôt want to hear it!!! And by the way!!!! Listen to me!!! Yes I was messing with your sister‚Äôs feelings!!! But keep listening to me!!!! But now I regret it and I‚Äôm actually in love with her even though I‚Äôm married! Listen! I‚Äôm the victim here!!! My feelings were hurt when I realized I actually liked your sister and had to leave her!!! And then I was tortured by kindness from your mother!! Woe is me for being a playa and rascal! And listen to me! Just listen!!! I was also stalking you the entire time! I‚Äôm not a creep at all! I‚Äôm really the victim here! Pity me!!! I had to pretend to be in love with another woman while I was ghosting your sister!!! And then my fianc√©e caught me and read Marianne‚Äôs letters!!!! I‚ÄôM THE VICTIM HERE, DON‚ÄôT YOU SEE???!?!?!? 
* This cancellation apology video is worst than Colleen Ballinger‚Äôs [Toxic Gossip Train](https://youtu.be/ceKMnyMYIMo)
* OK, so I know my sample size is only 2 of 6 Austen novels... but is there always an unhinged monologue at the 85-90% mark? Because if so, I'm here for it.
* V3ch10 - ah. I see what Austen did. We get an unhinged Willoughby apology so we can contrast it with a real one from Marianne.
* V3ch11 - Why is Elinor so hung up over a nothing burger like Ferrars???? Srsly. And also ‚Äî hi, high again ‚Äî- but can totally tell this is a deke. No way is he actually married with that shitty testimony from an unreliable messenger who can‚Äôt answer questions directly.
* v3ch12 - ok, I‚Äôm right. But‚Ä¶ why did Lucy marry Robert? And is Elinor settling on Edward? Whiplash? Also, another shitty apology from a man. I‚Äôm sorry I fell in love with you when I was promised to another. I‚Äôm the victim here, don‚Äôt you see?
* meh. Really meh. So Elinor settles for Edward. Marianne marries someone she doesn't really love.
