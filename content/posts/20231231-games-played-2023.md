[^1]: Incompete on T4, but convinced Ogrebeef to join us.
[^2]: Es practically ran this game as a project managing lawyer. We all played into the co-op game until Fabian (belatedly) started a private company to undermine the East Indies Dutch company.
[^3]: Bn ran this game, and somehow we all went into co-op mode, hence the absurdly high score. Everyone thought I had it with the early retirements, but Bn had a lot more power as the Prime Minister, and nobody knew until final scoring. I had two presidents out (Madras and Bengal)... hoping to retire them. It was foolish of me. They had no fatigue, so it was a 33% chance. And even if I did, I only had £11 with a blackmail card to borrow Ml's spouse plus mine for a £4 discount.
[^4]: Everyone but me was picking on Ml since she was leading... and if she had enough cash she could've grabbed the last DC for the win. But alas, I had to play kingmaker with the DC in the 0 column and handed it to Ed, some stranger Ma added to the game.
[^5]: Ad/B/C/Drw/P/S = Loss = Papacy 15 / England 26 / Protestant 22 / Hapsburg 12 / Ottoman 23 / France 16,  April 11th, 2023 - May 10th, 2023. Was this our first encounter with Dr. W? What a character.
[^6]: Aa/Ad/B/C/J/R = Loss = Papacy: 17 / Protestant: 23 / Ottoman: 28 / France: 23 / Hapsburg: 12 / England: 24, February 2nd, 2023 - April 10, 2023. "I invest the fortress".
