Dot took to singing in public places. Leaving the library, shopping down west fourth, traipsing through the local shops. She did not let loose with a full diva operatic in-the-shower voice, it was more folksy, soft-spoken, and heady. Onlookers did not seemed to bothered by her soft, lyrical mumbling. It was almost as if she was singing to herself.

Dot sang loudly as the streets of Seattle rinsed her in a warm April shower. The rivers of driven citizens flowed around her; few briefly glancing, most forming distracted eddies. She felt the splatter washing her, redeeming her, lifting her to a renewal -- baptism from the heaven itself. (sounds like an ending)

Dotty dot dot.
