**NOTE TO SELF:** As I type these out, maybe I was wrong to think I need to start with a clear ending in the ["play phase"](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/short-story-dissection-part-2/#play-like-a-puzzle)? Or maybe I do... eventually, but I still need a triggering event to come up with the shape of the plot points? As in, yes, it's important to work on the MECH, POV, and END... but I can't get the PROG or **shift from PLAY to DRAMATIZATION** without a STS or DSR (or beginning). In other words, it's very hard to get to a MID, LOW and CMX without a STS/DSR first.

**NOTE TO SELF:** A lot of these BMEs are not really well thought out. Some of the middles are more like the CMX of the story, but then again... I suppose if the ending is the DNM, especially in a short story where it's the last sentence, and the last chapter in a novel... then the majority of what happens if you simplify it to BME is in the middle where it's carrying the weight of Acts 2a, 2b and 3.
