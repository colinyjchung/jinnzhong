Reviewed notes from [August 16, 2017](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/short-story-plot-structure-study/), as deadline for "coming up with short stories" on October 8th, 2023 is fast coming for Garage Fiction. Realized that my foray into improv and standup between 2021-2023 was a significantly helpful diversion in understanding setup, 3-things/escalation, payoff.

At <5,000 words, you have about 4 to 6 scenes. That's enough for one encounter, one dynamic relationship (or conflict) between two characters, and one truth/reveal. Really, it's the protagonist against one antagonist or one dynamic character. A short story has *just* enough time to reveal ONE THING. That "one thing" can be a hidden cost, an escalated cost, or a secret truth.

I've also noticed that the more tropey a story, the less backstory/mechanism-explanation is required. But that also accounts for an story that doesn't break new ground into a new worlds. New worlds/settings require rules-explanation... even if as mundane as the elevator inside a 60s New York Apartment (I forget what Cheever story that is)... Or a recent Dominican/Haitian nanny hired by a white suburban family (I forget what Adichie story that is). In Lahiri's *A Temporary Matter*, it's literally a madeup game wherein the wife has to *explain the rules*. 

If the story is "really" mundane (as a lot of Cheever stories tend to be), the progress part is your typical "Rule of 3" where you show variations of the setup until the third one where something horrifying/terrifying happens that nails the theme.

|SETUP |PROGRESS |PAYOFF |
|---|---|---|
|   |3-Things/Escalate |Truth or Reveal | 
|   |Yes, but/No, and |Yes, and/No, but |
|---|---|---|
|Prot meets a stranger |Reveal goal, 3 arguments |changes mind |
|Prot goes to a place |Affects 3 NPCs |realizes consequences of actions |
|Prot abandoned/exiled |Meets savior, deals with change |goes or gets taken home |
|Prot ran away |Meets savior, savior gives rules |Prot breaks rules, discovers truth |
|Prot must follow ritual |Refuses and runs, or argues |Truth of why ritual revealed |
|Antag coming |Prot preps and defends |Deal with Antag |
|Antag attacks |Dynamic helps |Prot taken away |
|Prot new lover/ally |3 encounters |truth revealed |
|Prot bullied/attacked |Ask Dynamic for help |hidden cost |
|Ally gets new X (wife/kid/pet) |Prot finds X sus, hijinks |truth about X |
|Prot imprisoned, don't know why |Escapes or tries to |real reason of trap revealed |
|Prot must beat rival(s) |Enlists help from X |Hidden cost revealed |
|Prot assigned McGuffin job |Job reveals hidden cost(s) |Prot decides to abandon, or pay cost |

## Payoff/Reveals
* Halfman warns Prot of consequences - Prot decides to take the risk and pay it, or leaves
* Underworld with own rules is reveale - Prot gets burned
* The bad thing that happened in the past wasn't X's fault, it was Y
* Two characters voice the shared unspoken secret they've held back on saying
* The enlisted help is actually a monster (worst thing) and now Prot is trapped
* Prot can't really escape without paying the cost
* Fuck around and find out. Found out.
* Secret from the past revealed (affair, old promise/deal, real reason behind a death/breakup/firing)
* The McGuffin quest was a decoy/distraction from the real goal
