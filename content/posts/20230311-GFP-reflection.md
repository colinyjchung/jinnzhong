After not connecting with Bryan and Olivia for 1,030 days, we talked about resurrecting **Garage Fiction**. Olivia shared the trials and tribulations of being a professional Kindle author. It helped me clarify what I wanted as an author. I left the conversation with a clear directive from Bryan:

## What do I want my fiction to be?
* What do I want as an author? 
* What do I want my stories to do to the audience? 

This led me to ask myself...

* What makes my writing uniquely me? 
* What makes the way I think and see the world unique and interesting? 
* What would I want to leave in the audience's mind after they finish my work, what would cause that stayability I want to affect them?

## Things I like in my stories
* References, Easter eggs, and rabbit holes
* Based on history, creates an alternate history, or inspired by history 
* Story itself must work without audience picking up on all of the above


* I don't want to ghostwrite, edit, nor become a Kindle millionaire who writes "good enough" fiction that feeds the mass market the entertainment they want. This isn't a business for me. 
* I recognize I may never make money doing this.
* I  want to create something I'm proud of artistically
* I want the prose to be phrased well, not just workmanlike/functional prose.
* I want books that have strong themes and social commentary. I want to piss off the church, institutional evil, or whatever. 
* I want the misfits, loners, and weirdos of the world to know they're not alone and they can find their own family
* I understand this may not go anywhere and this completed novel may go nowhere, but I will have  written at least one novel
