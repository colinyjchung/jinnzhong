After not connecting with Bryan and Olivia for 1,030 days, we talked about resurrecting **Garage Fiction**. Olivia shared the trials and tribulations of being a professional Kindle author. It helped me clarify what I wanted as an author.

* I don't want to ghostwrite, edit, nor become a Kindle millionaire write "good enough" fiction that feeds the mass market the entertainment they want. This isn't a business for me. 
* I recognize I may never make money doing this.
* I  want to create something I'm proud of artistically
* I want the prose to be phrased well, not just workmanlike/functional prose.
* I want books that have strong themes and social commentary. I want to piss off the church, institutional evil, or whatever. 
* I want the misfits, loners, and weirdos of the world to know they're not alone and they can find their own family
* I understand this may not go anywhere and this completed novel may go nowhere, but I will have  written at least one novel
