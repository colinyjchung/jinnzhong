## SCENE ONE: (2243)
NEW RULE: Water starts falling on people when they lie in this world. NEW RULE: When you utter a paradox, you are filled with a sense of angst and doom, and you’re forced to speak something unequivocal. Gus, the protagonist’s boyfriend is doing it for fun. And then he says “I love you.” No water falls. In fact, his sweat evaporates. So the guy is telling the truth. This makes protagonist uneasy. He doesn’t want to hear this. They start to make out. Protagonist stops him. Protagonist says I don’t love you as much as you love me. It’s a lie. Freezing cold water falls on him. Gus laughs.

BACKSTORY: Instead of moving in with Gus, biotech engineer protagonist has been buying up tons of furniture for Gus. They get out of wet clothes and huddle under blankets. Gus proposes to him. Protagonist hesitates to say yes. He hasn’t told his family. He’s been using Chinese ambivalent word of ai ren and not naming him to avoid telling parents that Gus is a man.
