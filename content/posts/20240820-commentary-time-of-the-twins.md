The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _Time of the Twins_ (1986) by Tracy Hickman & Margaret Weis. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. For self-study purposes, there may also be **_extensive_ summaries of the plot** in these notes. In short...

## :warning: **MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** :warning:

* Prologue: The Meeting. Crysania goes to the Great Library of Palanthas to meet Raistlin Majere. Astinus the librarian doesn’t believe Raistlin will leave Tower of High Sorcery where he’s cloistered himself to two years now. Crysania says she had a dream from Paladine. Astinus doesn’t think that’s a thing. There’s a shit ton of backstory for Crysania and giving up her wealth to start a religion with Elistan. Raistlin shows up. Crysania delivers her message, that Raistlin will be destroyed for his evil deeds. He laughs. But after a coughing fit, invites her to the Tower. Puts a charm on her so she can walk through the groves of Shoiken.
* There is so much that happened but also so little. It’s literally two conversations. C&A, then C&R. Former states her purpose and proves Astinus wrong. Latter is Crysania delivering a weakass warning only to be invited to the Tower. The POV is Crysania and how she’s a neophyte with something to prove… very much a rich person does charitable work aka Buddha trope.

## Book One

* Ch. 1 - Tika is now manager of Inn of the Last Home. She is distracted, lashed out or avoidant when Cameron is brought up. POV jump to  Tanis who’s escorting a woman and reminiscing about his dead friend Flint Fireforge. Back to Tika, Otik is telling stories like a tourist guide, Tika is jumpy because friends are coming… when Riverwind walks in, asks about Cameron.
* Tika is waiting and lashing out. Tanis is regretting arriving back in Solace and haunted. Again. A lot of words, not much action, but a lot of good emotional interior stuff.
* this woman with Tanis that Weis & Hickman keep hiding her identity is Crysania right? Feels gimmicky to hide her identity to create suspense. But it works I guess. Because I’m not 100% sure and I’m kept guessing.
* Omg the names are so stupid. Starbreeze. Riverwind. Goldmoon. Stacking syllables. And then random words like Flotsam as a town name. I didn’t care about this as an eleven or twelve year old of course. But my god.
* Ch. 2 - Tanis arrives at the Inn of the Last Home. Stableboy stutters starstruck. Tika is still avoidant. Tanis and Riverwind talk about the uneasy and fragile peace. Riverwind refuses the job to escort Crysania to the Tower (so was the prologue a flash forward?). They trade stories about Caramon and then he arrives drunk and fat.
* This was a world stakes chapter. Trading news of what’s going on in the world politically.
* Ch. 3 - Tanis clears out the Inn. They talk and find out Caramon’s post legend life. Tanis can’t have Caramon escort Crysania, can’t stay to help Tika, has to go to Qualinesti to play politics and prevent war. His life is hard and he can’t be there for friends or do favors. 
* I was thinking this morning…. It’s really the emotional interior and relatable problems (dealing with, running interference for, and hiding an alcoholic husband) that makes this work. The fantasy elements are almost secondary. 
* ch. 4 - Caramon wakes up, looks for alcohol, drinks. Tika is mad obviously. Serves him breakfast angrily. Reveals his blacked out antics. Caramon is crying. Otik knocks to share the news Chrysania has left. Tika throws armor at Caramon and telling him to go find Chrysania. Tasslehoff breaks into the house, finds them fighting, joins, reveals his quest to find Bupu. Caramon is armored up, and kicked out of the house.
* ch. 5 - Kitiara visits her brother, Raistlin, at the Tower of High Sorcery. Kit has a ghost knight with her, Lord Soth. The Grove is creepy. Raistlin gets Soth’s respect. The conversation inside the tower amounts to Kit saying they can rule the world, and Raist saying he doesn’t care and he wants something else. (I’m assuming it’s godhood?). Kit reflects on how she prevented Raist from infantilized and now he’s super powerful. Kit leaves and says he must be stopped and to do that, she will have Lady Crysania murdered.
* I kinda feel like the portentous secret plan is out of fashion. It just felt silly. Ooh. Raistlin has a plan and everyone in the room knows, but we won’t tell the audience yet. They did this just a few chapters ago with Chrysania’s identity. I do like the family drama and background tho. And the lead up to and the actual entering the grove was cool. Ghost boyfriend was fun. All to pull a Worf baseline for power comparison. 
* Ch. 6 - Tasslehoff is babysitting a drunk Caramon on a tavern-hop while also preventing Bupu from running off. They come to a tavern that actually points the way.
* This is one of those chapters where you almost wonder if you could cut it as a reader. But I can see why we need to show Caramon’s state for future transformation. And Tasslehoff’s current state as well.
* Pg. 102 - why would you sleep with the fire going? This is DND wilderness 101. Don’t attract monsters.
* Draconian is such a stupid name for a species. Why don’t you name the elves xenophobians or aloofians.
* Ch. 7 - Caramon can’t protect or fight draconians in an ambush in which Tas did all the work. Chrysania heals them up but then the Solamic knight appears and casts Power Word Kill on her.
* It’s weird recognizing the clear and obvious reference to a level nine spell whereas when I read this as a kid, a decade before I would play actual D&D… I had no reference points for all the spells, monsters, and whatever else in these books.
* Ch. 8 - Dalamar, apprentice/spy, tells Raistlin that something bad has happened. Raistlin teleports to the Chamber of Seeing. Dalamar follows. There are misshapen beings called Live Ones, magical experiments gone wrong. And a pool of seeing. Raist touches the pool to get Bupu to use her dead lizard to revive dead Chrysania.
* Oh. So Dalamar isn’t a drow. “Dark Elf” is literally his nickname and not his race. Lame.
* We’re at past the 25% mark and I’m still not clear what the overarching goal of this story is. What’s Raistlin doing to become the greatest magic user ever? How will Chrysania convert him and prevent him from becoming the darkest sorcerer? I mean I guess I know their goal, but there’s no indication of the quest. Caramon and Tasslehoff is escorting Chrysania. Raistlin is wanting her there. Kitiara is trying to stop Raistlin. I dunno. Were all 80s/90s fantasy novels all over the map like this? Multiple POVs and multiple threads?
* Ch. 9 - ok. We’re at the 31% mark and we’ve just announced the actual goal of this PROG. Raistlin is going back in time to talk to Fistandantilus (another absurdly long and stupid name), a powerful wizard Raistlin has collected a lot of his spell books, which I’m still guessing and have zero confirmation that he wants to become a god? And he needs Crysania to help open some door? And he knows Dalamar is a spy. 
* Ch. 10 - the Wayreth forest finds Tasslehoff and Caramon. Caramon quits drinking. Caramon hears songs and Raistlin’s voice. Then two figure in white robes appear to lead them.
* Everybody’s talking way too effusively. This is just bad explaining myself dialogue. Nobody shares their thoughts like this without subtlety. Also. Songs and poems. Hard skim.
* Come to think of it, some of Caramon’s alcoholism has been a little caricature and silly.
* Ch. 11 - Crysania goes to Raistlin’s Tower for the weirdest date ever. First they walk through dangerous territory where she’s frightened enough to lock arms with Raistlin (motorbike ride trope basically), then he shows off his cool apartment, then they have a philosophical argument wherein he points out he and she are alike, and then self-made-poor-boy shows pretty-rich-girl how she’s ignored the world’s misery and was sheltered, then he shares his vision of the future (or magicking the past). This kinda reminds me of Christine Comaford dating Gates and Ellison from her book.
* Pg. 137 - this is the weirdest first date ever.
* Hah. Raistlin’s diet is Minotaur fruit, bread, and wine. Should turn into a supplement sales letter. Secret fruit from the isle of Mithras.
* Jennifer Morrison reprising her role on House MD as the woman who falls for broken men. That’s who I would cast for Crysania.
* OH MY FUCKING GOD RAISTLIN IS AN AYN RAND LOVING TECH BRO.
* pg. 146 - Omfg. Just tell me what Raistlin’s stupidass plan is. You’ve dragged it out for 146 pages now. Is it godhood? Is it changing all the rules of the world with time travel? What?
* Ch. 12 - It’s exposition disguised as dialogue time! Par-Salian reveals that he pushed Raistlin to take the Test before he was ready, but Fistandantilus’ soul went into his body or something? Dalamar rends his clothing. Caramon proposes to time travel.
* ch. 13 - more backstory time! Tasslehoff tells conclave why Crysania assigned him the task of finding Bupu. Bupu tells her son story. And I’m like, JFC, one iota of compassion doesn’t mean you can redeem a psychopath. wtf. This is such an 80s trope. “If he only had one shred of good in him, he’s worth saving”. As we’ve seen now, CEOs can be nice people, but they’re still going to lay off millions, poison the planet, and falsify/manipulate the market to serve their shareholders. They’re doing their job. And Raistlin is going to Raist because that’s the only position he has. There’s no exit for him.
* ch. 14 - more hiding shit from the readers. I think this technique is lame and out of date. So Par-Salian has seen some sort of consequence for _not_ sending Crysania back in time, she has to die, and Caramon will come back. And Caramon is not going back to save Raistlin’s soul but some other? 
* I feel like Ishiguro’s cliffhangers work a lot better. But why? It’s still Kathy retelling the past and hinting at future events and holding back info right? Maybe it’s because the payoff is relatively quick? Or there’s actual tension in between drop and pay off? I think what’s annoying me here is the drop is dropped and then dragged on without any proper momentum or present time tension so I just have to watch the author move things along. 
* ch. 15 - Tas explores and filches a bunch of things, comes back, sees Justinian? Justorian? Justinator? Disappear Bupu back to her home. Then goes after Tasslehoff. Tas puts on a magic ring he finds, shrinks, becomes a white rat. Red Robed mage named J-Dawg picks him up.
* Ch. 16 - Tas gets a free ride on J-Dawg while J-Dawg escorts Caramon to Par-Salian’s laboratory where he’s casting the time travel spell. Tas chews through the pouch he’s in and scurries into the lab and at the last minute jumps into the ring/portal. Par-Salian didn’t catch it in time. 

**END OF BOOK ONE.**

## Book Two

* Ch. 1 - They travel back in time and Caramon still reeks of alcohol and Tas is a kender nobody believes in and they have a beat up white cleric next to them. Denubis is told by the Dark One (Raistlin?) to go find them with town guards. Caramon and Tasslehoff get thrown in jail.
* Ch. 2 - Denubis is bored by elven choirs. Gets pulled away to the Kingpriest, learns Crysania is safe, but then told by Quareth that Caramon and Tasslehoff will be sold into slavery. During this entire time Fistandalus is hanging about in the background.
* Ch. 3 - Caramon and Tasslehoff are taken to the slavery block, after Tasslehoff had broken the lock and Caramon had broken the door. They spot Fistandalus in the crowd.
* p.237 - slavery is the solution to poverty. Sounds almost modern and not in the realm of ancient fantasy… but it also might not be. Would need to know more history.
* Ch. 4 - Crysania’s been drugged into sleep after rambling about the future, wakes up later to find a letter from Par-Salian explaining her situation. Quareth and Elsa are not to be trusted
* Ch. 5 -Quareth snuck into Crysania’s room to read Par-Salian’s letter and misinterprets it in the worse way. Wants dinner with Fistandalus, but finds out he bought Caramon and Tasslehoff and has left the temple to the Tower in Wayreth. Wants to talk to Arack Rockbreaker. CUT TO: Arack relating to Caramon and Tasslehoff how he started the WWE in Ishtar after the Kingpriest banned the gladiatorial games.
* OK… plot’s getting a little too meandering here. Nothing seems to be happening that’s plot relevant.
* Ch. 6 - cue _Eye of the Tiger_. Caramon is buffed up with training. Arack discovers Caramon’s stage name after rich white teens swooned over him. Tasslehoff is wandering the city.
* Yeah, ok, I am reading this after my one week rabbit hole into Marvel Unlimited… and this chapter, like the last, is cute… but feels like it’s dragging on the plot. I know, I get it, we need to get Caramon buff again and sober. We _need_ this chapter. 
* Ch. 7 - deceived! Caramon kills The Barbarian with a real knife instead of a collapsible one. They find out Fistandalus owns them.
* Ch. 8 - Caramon and Tas walk through the streets and straight into the Temple of Palanthas. They’re media darlings now. Guards let them in. Caramon is about to kill Fistandalus while Tas keeps watch at the end of the corridor. It’s Raistlin! Saw that coming chapters ago…
* Ch. 9 - wow. Raistlin is such an asshole. My scrawny nerd 11yo self really needed this power fantasy huh? This whole chapter was Raistlin being a dick towards Caramon.
* Ch. 10 - Denubis is pulled away by Loralon. Raistlin convinces Crysania that the Kingpriest is a flawed man.
* Ch. 11 - Crysania and Raistlin almost fucks. Raistlin berates himself for getting horny. Quarath is told Fistandalus isn’t the one who killed his fighter. Caramon mopes.
* Ch. 12 - Tas is spying on Crysania and Raistlin almost fucking again. But then interrupts them and tells Raistlin his plan to prevent The Cataclysm.
* That’s four short chapters of build up and going nowhere.
* Ch. 13 - Raistlin has a dirty dream about the Dark Queen. Crysania has a guilt-trip dream from Palandine. Tas and Caramon see a green sky.
* Ch. 14 - Caramon talks to Crysania, tells her they must go. Raistlin reveals Parsalian’s dirty trick to Crysania and how the device only carries one person.
* Ch. 15 - Caramon realizes (for the millionth time) Raistlin is evil, that he played everyone. And then realizes the real reason Parsalian sent him back. To kill his brother.
* Ch. 16 - Tasslehoff was asked to steal the device and hide in the chamber of secrets. Crysania prays through her doubt. Loralon appears and asks her to leave with him. Kingpriest has another fascist prayer thinking he’s in the right.
* Ch. 17 - Caramon is bullied into the arena. Tasslehoff activates the device only to realize Raistlin tricked him into breaking it. Crysania is praying, and ignores Tas. Kiiri and Pheragas sorta believes Caramon and they fight together. Kiiri turns into a bear and kills Raag the Ogre. The Red Minotaur kills Pheragas, Caramon shatters his knee, feigns a slip, and beheads the minotaur. Arack stabs Kiiri. Kiiri throws Arack at the pinnacle and he's impaled by something. Everybody's ded.
* Ch. 18 - Crysania is going to Raistlin as if hypnotized even though Quarath and gang try to stop her. The temple crumbles and collapses. Tas is our POV witnessing this. Caramon too is entranced and tunnel-visioned into killing Raistlin.
* Ch. 19 - Raistlin casts his spell. Caramon tries to stop him. Crysania steps between them. Uses medallion of Paladine to stop him. Tas enters. They're all gone.
