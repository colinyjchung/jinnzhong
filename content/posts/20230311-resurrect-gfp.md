Bryan, Olivia, and I are looking to “resurrect” Garage Fiction, but version 3.0 will be drastically different. 

**Here’s what we’d like it to be:** a monthly live check-in where we set goals, talk about what we managed to do (or not do), and support each other. This call will be recorded and thrown up as a podcast (or not). Regardless, we’d like to record it just in case anyone wishes to listen to it again.

Ultimately, this will be a low-effort, minimum-work, hyper-focused on your writing iteration of Garage Fiction. 

There will be no obligation to review other people’s work, no expectation you help with the podcast (editing, administrative), no pressure to produce work just for the sake of producing work. 

The reason for this proposal is because…

**What we don’t want:** What didn’t work in Garage Fiction 2.0 was, well, basically everything that wasn’t us writing fiction. It felt like (at least for me) we were spending a lot more time reviewing other’s work, giving feedback, running a weekly podcast, talking about how to help the group, and ensuring everyone submitted work each week… instead of actually writing fiction. (The weekly rhythm was also way too intense).

So, in short, Garage Fiction 3.0 will be a monthly recorded support/update call on Saturday at 8AM Pacific/4PM British that may be thrown up as a “lazy unedited podcast”… with the only focus that you keep writing fiction and have a group to lean on.
