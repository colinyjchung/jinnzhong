The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _Rich and Pretty_ (2016) by Rumaan Alam. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. For self-study purposes, there may also be **_extensive_ summaries of the plot** in these notes. In short...

## :warning: **MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** :warning:

* Ch. 3/ pg. 37 - I‚Äôm sorry to confess I didn‚Äôt pick up the POV change in chapter three until six pages in, but once I did and reread it‚Ä¶ I started tearing up. There‚Äôs something really beautiful happening here between two friends who have moved on but not quite and are still bundled up in insecurities, their judgment of each other, this is what makes fiction unique as a medium. Nothing else lets you get into the emotional interiors of characters like this. And there‚Äôs something so incredibly sad about how Sarah and Lauren see each other but would never tell each other because they‚Äôre simply not even aware of how they think about each other. Sarah came off as a rich spoiled insecure brat from Lauren‚Äôs POV, living a life of unemployed leisure. Lauren came off as a self-entitled, uncaring friend who never quite puts enough attention or energy into the friendship that Sarah obviously values, and Lauren doesn‚Äôt (she could throw it away for all she cared), and this small antagonism is what‚Äôs driving the story. All this unspoken dynamic that we as readers get access to through their POV.
* Omg. I just read the author‚Äôs bio on the back of the book. Rumaan Alam is a dude. wtf. I‚Äôm sorry for asking, but is he gay? Because if he‚Äôs straight, I am even more impressed. 
* So I had to go to some wiki-knockoff site called factsbuddy to get the tea. Yes. Openly gay with two adopted sons.
* Ch. 6/pg. 64 - Lauren kinda sucks. She‚Äôs this self-absorbed misanthrope who just wants to be left alone. I know I know. That‚Äôs me, too. But she still sucks. As do I.
* Ch. 8/pg. 86 - Lauren and Sarah‚Äôs backstory in one chapter, wrapped in Lauren thinking about how Karen is her only work friend, and someone who‚Äôs perceptive unlike Lauren who is not.
* Pg. 94 - the reveal of what happened to Christoper, Sarah‚Äôs dead brother, is going to be crushing, isn‚Äôt it? Isn‚Äôt it, Rumaan???!
* Ch. 9/pg. 98 - Sarah as a people pleaser to the nth degree contrasts so well with Lauren as a self-absorbed person.
* Pg. 107 - you‚Äôre my life partner. ü•≤
* Ch. 12/pg. 132 - Lauren giving up Gabe because she felt nothing about it the relationship is so real and also so sad. She wasn‚Äôt opposed to it but also wanted tempted by it. Nothing in her drove her to say yes or no and it just lapsed and nothing happens and Gabe moves out. 
* At the end of the day, someone like Sarah is very much my relationship with KD. Inscrutable, super Midwestern nice KD. Popular, empathetic, enthusiastic, thinks about you, keeps tabs on you, takes notes on your preferences‚Ä¶ but I would never feel close to her like I do with other friends. I need that slight cynicism, that slight bitterness at the world. It‚Äôs probably why AM and I worked so well together. The shared trauma of growing up poor. 
* I mean, just the way Lauren never knows what to say when people say everyday niceties. It‚Äôs awkward to her. Whereas Sarah just glides through it.
* Of course, Sarah is always begging for reassurance she‚Äôs doing the right thing. It‚Äôs framed as checking in, or she downplays and even insults the situation, playing the victim, says she hates it, but really she just needs Lauren to approve her choices. To tell her she‚Äôs doing the right thing. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs better to constantly seek approval as a way through life, but actually doing stuff, or to never ask for feedback and then being awkward about it and just letting things slide.
* Ch. 14/pg. 160 - Sarah‚Äôs entire character is about taking care of other people and ensuring everybody is comfortable and in turn, she expects the same of her best friend. She‚Äôs not mad that Lauren slept with the waiter as a morally superior prudish thing even tho that‚Äôs what Lauren thinks, she‚Äôs mad that it create a situation that made her uncomfortable amongst her friends on this vacation, which is something Lauren will never fully understand.
* And that was the MID. We have a mirror moment not so much as one PROT seeing themselves but the relationship, the friendship, making a genuine reflection on who they are to each other, what they mean to each other.
* **STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS** pg. 119 is when the resort stuff started (so about 40%). 100ish is where Lauren tells Sarah about the promotion, they fight about Gabe/Greg, and Sarah brings up the island bachelorette party‚Ä¶ basically doing all the planning work for Lauren who hasn‚Äôt done a single thing as maid of honor. (33%).  The 20% mark is where Laura bumps into Jill Hansen, who is doing what she hasn‚Äôt - grown up and settled down. And where Sarah in the next chapter tries on the wedding dress, which is something she hates (being the center of attention versus taking care of everyone else). It‚Äôs a good way to end act one.
* Ch. 15/pg. 182 - Sarah‚Äôs pregnant 
* Ch. 16/pg. 194 - Lauren truly admires Sarah. She mights be insecure but outwardly she can handle herself and solve problems. That‚Äôs something Lauren looks up to.
* Ch. 18/pg. 231 - oof. This sentence: ‚ÄúSarah hates doing what is expected of her, even though that‚Äôs what she ends up doing most of the time.‚Äù
* Ch. 19/pg. 246 - heh. Sarah wins in the end. No attention allowed for the pregnancy.
* Ch. 19/pg. 251 - oh I see what you‚Äôre doing Rumaan. Bookending the novel with another party where Lauren goes to one of Sarah‚Äôs get-together and the two sneak off to reminisce about their lives and avoids the crowd who‚Äôs there out of ritual and not genuine connection. I see you.
* Ch. 19/pg. 265 - just the love and admiration Sarah has for Lauren. It‚Äôs heartbreaking how much she loves her and Lauren knows, but I don‚Äôt think Lauren will ever truly understand how much Sarah loves her. This is such an achingly beautiful friendship.
* Ch. 20/pg. 277 - are we jumping forward in time? Is that how we‚Äôre ending this book?
* Ch. 20/pg. 286 - oh so they‚Äôre not telling each other every major thing five years on. They‚Äôre keeping secrets from each other
* Ch. 20/pg. 290 - fuck. I‚Äôm crying. Crying in a strange bed in a Reykjavik Airbnb. Their lives just moved on. That‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no sad miserable drama or traumatic event. It simply moved on. They each had their own personal traumas and tribulations and they just don‚Äôt share everything with each other anymore and that‚Äôs just life moving onwards and it‚Äôs passes by you and your closest friends just move on and you don‚Äôt talk anymore.
