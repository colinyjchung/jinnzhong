**Based on**: _Three Is A Rational Number_ by Michele Finn Johnson - [source](https://www.havehashad.com/web_features/three-is-a-rational-number)

1. POV witnesses two characters get together over a questionable foundation/premise/secret-deal. (POV is friend/ally/family). Maybe character-in-relationship (CIR) is getting "paid"
2. Other friend asks POV about new relationship. Makes POV wonder about CIR. Nobody seems to question or care that CIR is getting perks from relationship.
3. CIR runs to POV for help. CIR broke up with dealmaker. POV and friend defends/protects CIR.
