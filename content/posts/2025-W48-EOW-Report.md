## Anti-Goal Cycling

* MRK SSC in full swing. Waking up early on Sundays again to join the "Make Me Write" sessions. Last Sunday, it was [prj:BOXED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-boxed/), this Sunday was [prj:ATOMS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-atoms/). Both projects are mostly outlined on the day of. It's a remarkable, noticeable difference from two years ago. There's no more insecurity about the story structure, the arc, the execution on the concept. Is the execution perfect? Of course not. But is the idea mostly drafted out to the point where I can actually work on it during the week in a way that makes actual, actionable progress? Yes. It's truly remarkable how far I've come in the last two years.
* This week was mostly [prj:BOXED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-boxed/). I am making it too complicated by wanting to have the characters speak in Shakespearean iambic and prose. But I did manage to get the thumbnail down, wrote out a whole TYS from beginning to end, and also added more emotional depth to it. I'm treating it like it's an exercise as MRK says (it's OK to not have all stories be polished for publication. Some can just be practice/etudes). But as I add more layers to it, I might change my mind.  Started drafting the prose at Toyota on Saturday and really got into it Sunday morning.
* Monday was my 1on1 call with MRK. Main question I had was I feel like I'm writing too slow. She pointed out that I am actually _not_ writing too slow. It was the reframe I needed. Given the amount of time I have available each week... and the fact that I genuinely, truly, enjoy doing what I'm doing -- adding research, Easter eggs, and oblique references -- that pleasure is part of the process. "SLOWNESS" to MRK is if you're just STUCK and can't move forward. Which was where I was in the first year in 2024 and even early 2025. SLOWNESS is if you can't move the story forward. If you're actually moving forward and you're enjoying the process, you are fine. That was revelatory.
* Not exactly anti-goal cycling, but adjacent enough... was at Muji today after Christmas Market for a family outing, and found A4 stationary. Got a 30-ring binder, some sleeves, and card holders. I find myself enjoying writing on A4 better than any other European ISO size. A5 might work for some brainstorming. A6 and A7 is just absurd. Who the fuck finds this useful? (Of course, I have a stack of A7s from Japan from earlier this year). B5 is nice, but I don't understand all these B sizes. I dunno. I _get_ A4. It's the close to Letter, and I know that each line is about 12-13 words, and I know that at 7mm, a page is about 375 words. And that's about the same as a printed page. Like it just helps me with the timing/pacing as well. A4 just works. Of course, now I'm tempted by other things, like a zippered-leather pen holder... and more fancy A4 stationary along with DL envelopes... and more inks. I still want to try Pelikan 4001s and Edelsteins because I was told a dryer ink might be better for my Waterman Hémisphère. Might be good for my left-handed middle one too. Waterman apparently has a dryer ink too.
* Started _Vermeer's Hat_ (2007). Such a delightful book that shows the early beginnings of globalism in Early Modern Europe. And the professor is at UBC! MT offered to introduce me to him, but I wouldn't even know where to begin a conversation with him, just like I wouldn't know what to say to Ada Palmer if he did the same. But also - finally set up and had a call with MT on Wednesday to chat about Darnton, Burke, and Grafton. Such a genuine pleasure and still always in disbelief that I get to have conversations with a Harvard history professor because of some weird connect from Slack during the pandemic. We set up a time to connect over the holidays where I'll probably pick up a Platinum Century #3776 at the Vancouver Pen Shop.

* Still no M809. Called Buchan Stationary. It doesn't look like any of the major online retailers have them yet either... except maybe one or two American ones. That said, really falling into a good routine of using fountain pens during the fiction writing hour in the morning, writing Christmas cards and letters first thing at the office, and drafting in general. Also fell into a related rabbit hole on American Thanksgiving while also getting a lot of deep work done. Probably will not act on it. It is yet another distraction. Need to keep recommitting to the overall and ultimate goal. But it was amusing that this rabbit hole was brought to you by none other than MRK back in 2010.
* Wife is rewatching _Stranger Things_ (2016-2025) and I'm passively rewatching it as well during dinner. Skipped the Vancouver Genre Writers meetup on Friday night. Just felt like another rabbit hole that would end up being a distraction, and not a fun one. I don't even know why I signed up for it. Saturday was Prius Checkup. Tuesday was roof cleaning with eldest dealing with it while I texted the contractor. Was prickly with the Apple Business consultant (who calls and leaves voicemails still tho?). Big news was a conversation with CEO at Client A and a bonus offer.
* Overall, it was a slow and steady week along with American Thanksgiving providing a nice buffer as I adapt to MRK SSC's schedule, which is heavy.

## Story Introspection

* Wrapped up November with my lowest comic book count since I first started this hobby. Nor surprised. Pull count is reduced to 15 ongoings and 5 minis... with more to wrap up before end of year. Birds of Prey next week :(. Ultimate Spider-Man Jan 28. Cheetah and Cheshire Rob the Justice League Jan 7. There are a lot of Vertigo and DC Next Level coming up in the Spring, but that's a future problem.
* It's mostly been working through _The Count of Monte Cristo_ (1844) very slowly one chapter a day to keep my quota up. Once I started MRK SSC last weekend, it's been very low on story consumption. Oh, and I read the introduction to _The Aeneid_ (-19).
