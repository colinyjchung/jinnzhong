**Based on**: _Jackalope Wives_ by Ursula Wives - source: _Jackalope Wives and Other Stories_ (2017).

1. Describe a weird ritual/process/event: what happens, where/when, how everyone is aware of it and how they see it, put up with it, or tolerate it, the temptation to hack it, or be part of it, and the consequences of failure if you try to mess around with it. This is your MECH.
2. Describe the one idiot who will attempt to intrude, sneak into, infiltrate, try to be a part of, attempt to join the MECH. The idiot who thinks they are the exception.
3. The attempt is half-assed, creates a huge mess, and the mess is brought to the POV to fix. POV is an elderly, wiser, more experienced, almost a shaman person in the community of outsiders of the MECH.
4. The "easy solution" is considered, but not executed on for reasons of mercy, of integrity, of honor, of whatever.
5. The POV does it the hard (but correct and ethical way). They need to go into the home of the MECH, and in fixing this mess, it is REVEALED that POV was once part of the MECH, and was a victim of being "pulled out" of the MECH by a similar idiot.
6. They are offered a chance to return to MECH, but the POV says it's too late for them. They've acclimated to their life outside of MECH.
