## PREMISE
Hook (Primary Event) --> Expanded Idea --> Generic Characters --> Fleshed Out Characters --> Plot

**INITIAL IDEA must have 2 of 3 things:**
1. Primary Event
2. Arc of Story (BME), or...
3. Intriguing Situation that immediately suggests a **Cast of Characters**

## PROCESS
1. Idea --> Research (travel, interviews, pictures) -->
2. Characters  (as you flesh out, plot thickens) -->
3. Step Outline (15 rough scenes) -->
4. Running Plot Outline -->
5. Sketch out each scene (POV, Voice, etc.) -->
6. First Draft Fast (5 a day) -->
7. Editorial Letter -->
8. Second Draft (50 a day) -->
9. Cold Reader

Create blueprint/marketing for each LOCATION

## Story is Character

1. Flaws
2. Past mistakes = doubt in themselves
3. Growth
4. Core need - "The need to be…." (Our Diamond Excuse, Racket)
5. Pathological reaction - "When our homeostasis is rocked…" (delusions, obsessions, compulsions, addictions, denials, hysterical ailments, hypochondria, illnesses, self-sabotage, harm others, abuse, manias, phobia)
6. Sexuality
7. Trauma - "a circumstance in the past that had a huge impact" (which gives us ACTS)
8. Wants

**pg. 7**
So the basic guidelines in creating characters should be:
* Give them flaws,
* Allow them to doubt themselves about something,
* See to it they grow and change, and
* Make certain you are putting them into conlfict

**pg. 41**
Plot is what the characters DO to deal with the situation they are in. It is a LOGICAL SEQUENCE of events that grow from an INITIAL INCIDENCE that ALTERS THE STATUS QUO of the characters.

PRIMARY EVENT gets the ball rolling - creates conflict, change

**pg. 43**
Skilled writers know that what you're supposed to do is continually OPEN UP your story

You do this by creating scenes in which you lay down -- but do not answer -- dramatic quesitons. 

## CREATE SUSPENSE

T. Jefferson Parker --
> "When my story stalls out on me. I've played my hand too soon: When you're stuck, it's because you put out too early"

**THAD (Talking Head  Avoidance Device)**
Something the characters are doing WHILE having dialogue to avoid talking heads.

## 8 hooks to start novels
1. Name a character in a book
2. Tell the reader something significant in the plot
3. Show the reader a personality quirk
4. Illustrate character's attitude
5. Show the way the narrator's mind works
6. Give a clue or trick in the plot
7. Lead the reader into excitement
8. Render a mysterious or suspenseful occurence

POV
Voice (attitude)
Dialogue

THE SCENE -- ACTUAL WRITING
Dramatic Narration
Full Scene
Partial

**pg. 139**
Be careful that the scene adds something necessary to the story's devleopment: information, revelation, discovery, sudden change. If the scene you're creating doesn't do any of this, then what you have is something that doens't need to go into a scene in the first place. That means there must be conflict. Think of a scene as you would a complete story."

## Types of Scenes
1. Motion Picture (establishing shot, characters, dialogue)
2. Sound vs. Sight
3. Present, Past, Present

**pg. 167**
I consider suspense one of the most misunderstood elements of fiction writing, right up there with point of view and voice

**SUSPENSE CREATES WANTS IN READERS**
1. What happens to character
2. What happens to situation
3. What happens to plot?

## CREATE CARE
* When we care, we are invested
* Character is the most obvious and easiest way
* Plot is next
* Devices are clunky unless executed really well
* Murder, fighting, discovery or working against time.
* Or MacGuffin everyone is after.

**TRUST YOUR BODY, THE MIND LIES**

**pg. 177**
Having no process is like having no craft
Idea must generate a cast of characters
