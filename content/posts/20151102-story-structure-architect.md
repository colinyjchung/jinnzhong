## Ways to Structure the Story

* **Rollercoaster**: Ups and downs
* **Replay**: Multiple characters recall the same event
* **Fate**: Climax first - flashback -- climax again, and then...
* **Parallel**: Two storylines colliding
* **Episodic**: Theme related
* **Melodrama**: Family Tragedy
* **Romance**: Cinderella / Beauty & the Beast / Sleeping Beauty
* **Journey**: Major internal growth - awakening/rebelling
* **Interactive**: Branching like video games
* **Metafiction**: Playing with the form
