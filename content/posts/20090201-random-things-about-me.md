1. I was born in 1981... which straddles Generation X and Generation Y. I have a hard time with physical reality sometimes. For example, I don't understand why I can't just "drag and drop" my real garbage like I do with computer files.
2. I've had four reincarnations of rock bands that never got beyond my parent’s-basement-turned-studio. I miss jamming dearly. I played the guitar and sang.
3. If I had no social and financial obligations, I would become a Jabba flop-of-a-mess on my couch watching Criterion DVDs, playing all the Final Fantasy's I missed since IV on SNES and maybe finally write fiction again.
4. I adore tightly-wrought, gritty stories with a sci-fi or fantastical element. To me, if you write science fiction or fantasy, it is your JOB to make sure you address all S.T.E.E.P. aspects of the world (S.T.E.E.P. stands for social, technology, economics, environmental and politics.) There is nothing worse than "imaginative writers" who create worlds with inconsistent or non-existent S.T.E.E.P. rules.
5. If you “got” number four… you should consume, if not already… Transmetropolitan (1997) by Warren Ellis, A Song of Ice and Fire (1996) by George R.R. Martin, HBO’s Rome (2005-2007), Six Feet Under (2001-2005), Cowboy Bebop (1998-1999), Pump Six and Other Stories (2006) by Paolo Bacigalupi (1972-), Stories of Your Life and Others (2002) by Ted Chiang, The Bourne Trilogy (2002-2007), His Dark Materials (2000) trilogy by Philip Pullman, Spider-Man 2 (2004), The Ultimates (2002-2004) by Mark Miller, Hellblazer (1988-2013) (the REAL Constantine), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009) (the new one)… oh and Lost (2004-2010), of course.
6. I can't help but see systems, statistical measurements, taxonomy, process and workflows. It's how my brain is wired. Mind you, I didn't go to school for this stuff... just "drew it out" working at a contact center. Excel and Visio are my best friends. This left-brain part of me is a major reason why I love direct response marketing. Numbers don't lie.
7. Yes, I'm a jerk. An A-hole. My IQ is probably higher than yours. And that is EXACTLY why I had to drop-out of university. After reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad (1997)," it really hit home for me... how SOCIALLY MALADJUSTED I am... how stuck in my head I am and how if I don't drop the "holier-than-thou" front, I will never make an entrepreneurial dime. I refuse to end up as an academic-type who bemoans the "world-that-is" compared to the "world-that-should-be."
8. My favourite line in RDPD… (I’m probably misquoting it) “I don’t know why things are the way they are. I’m not here to change it either. I only know that these are the rules of the game and I know how to use them.”
9. I'll always have an edge. Such is life. Just know that I'm not intentionally insensitive around you as a friend or family member. Most of the time, I don't even notice I’m being a jerk. As a competitor in the business world however... jungle rules apply. If you're a colleague, business partner or client... I am your snarling Rottweiler.
10. I get laser-focused on objectives, projects and results easily… to the detriment of keeping up with friends or family. If I haven’t reached out to you in a while it’s not because I don’t like you anymore.
11. re: eBay team. I miss the camaraderie of a tight-knit team where each and every member was dedicated and engaged to a cause, a mission, a unified goal. When we were up against the wall fighting for our lives. Back when we *cared* deeply about something.
12. I like to have even-more-provocative friends around me... keeps me sane. Whenever I talk to D.O., I realize, "Wow... I'm not *that* offensive". So yeah, I enjoy gallows humor and dirty jokes. Sarah Silverman (the stand up, not the actor) makes me laugh because she “goes too far.” Family Guy (1999- ), too. Is this a product of me growing up in a public school system that KEPT pounding “political correctness” into us? Probably.
13. Living in Vancouver spoils me in two ways. One, growing up in a multicultural city open to all lifestyle choices makes me completely BLIND to prejudices of any sort. When someone makes a racist, sexist or gay-bashing comment and it’s NOT a joke…. It REALLY throws me. I simply don’t "get" it… How anyone can hate another group due to the way they came into the world biologically.
14. The second way Vancouver spoils me is the cuisine diversity. I cannot imagine EVER living somewhere where I can’t walk a few blocks to get Indian, Japanese, Italian, Thai, Chinese, Mexican, Korean, Greek, etc. etc… and authentic, too! (Well… we have a lot sushi bars up here ran by Koreans and Chinese people… don’t tell the gwai los tho.)
15. I’m an agnostic. I’m not cocky enough to say God doesn’t exist. Sixteen years of church-going might have been an influence… but the vastness and mystery of the world that eludes us… that’s a stronger reason for not becoming a bona-fide atheist.
16. My wife won’t stop accusing me of having a man-crush on House (2004-2012).
17. If granted three wishes… One, fluent in every form of communication on earth. Two, speed-of-light brain processing power. Three, immortality – I’m extremely curious about humanity’s future and… I really want to see how it all ends.
18. The first instrument I fell in love with and wanted to learn was the saxophone. I know how to play the piano, guitar, bass and drums now… but still no saxophone.
19. IF, and I mean IF, I had a man-crush on anyone… it would have been Jeff Buckley when I was younger.
