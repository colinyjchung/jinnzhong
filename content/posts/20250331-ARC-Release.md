The Release Arc is where the PROT has unprocessed trauma and they've created a homeostasis where things are "just OK" or and they're surviving "FINE!" They may have lost someone, got betrayed/abandoned, or hurt someone in the past and they're now self-flagellating or punishing themselves inside this cage. And that's what it really is: self-imprisonment. That is, until, a catalyst comes along to yank them out of their current existence. The catalyst can be a new character (who reminds them of their past hurt), or someone from their past who represents their past hurt, like a ghost that haunts them.

This PROG is usually one where the quest is a reflection of their past hurt, where they're forced to face that past hurt, and/or the new character in their life reminds them of their past hurt and in saving them, they are in a way getting a "second chance" to make things right (or at least process and heal their trauma).

The Release Arc is most often a POSITIVE ARC that teaches us to let go of resentment, shame, grief, past failures.


## The Emotional Arc

* **STS**: _Things are fine! It's not perfect, but I'm coping. What?! I'm not in denial!_
* **DSR**: [x forces change] _I can't deal with this right now! I'm too busy! No time! Not my problem!_
* **BWO**: _OK. FINE. I'll fix this quickly and then go back to my old normal._
* **PNR**: _Goddammit, I can't just fix X. I also have to fix Y. And OMG... who am I?_
* **AIL**: _I tried to do good, tried to change, but it's too much! I regret trying!_
* **CMX**: _Actually, no. I can grow and accept myself, own my past, stop hiding. I can fix this._

_alt. CMX_: We rarely see stories where PROT doesn't let go. Villains and ANTGs might not. OR... we're talking about FLAT ARC characters who change just a little bit, or have a devastating epiphany, only to fall back to status quo again as it's a serialized, licensed IP. (Don Draper, Batman, House MD)

## The Stakes

* Losing control over well-constructed homeostasis even though it's imperfect or even toxic.
* Having to face a traumatic past, face ghosts
* Having to face a past failure or wrong where you hurt someone you cared about

## The Triangle(s)

* PROT: The Denialist using unhealthy coping mechanism:
   * ASSHOLE/BITCH: keep people away. You can't trust them.
   * HUSTLER: con people before they con you first.
   * MAVERICK: fuck the man, don't follow rules, and ALWAYS do your own thing. Rebel.
   * ANAL-RETENTIVE: follow the letter of the law because that's how you protect yourself.
   * LONER/HERMIT/FUGITIVE: always be running, keep away from people. Keep head down.
* A Mission/Project or New Person that shakes them loose
* Current friends/family they harm inside the homeostasis but put up with them.
