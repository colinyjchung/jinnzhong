## Highlights This Week

* Spent a few mornings this week working on a response to LJK's comments. Helped me clarify the January Incident, and made me realized how a driving motivation of my life has shaped and defined it, which led to a vacuum when I tried to write fiction as the usual value prop was non-existent. GFP thinks I'm stalling, and I can't completely disagree with them either. 
* Garage Fiction Podcast monthly support group. Good percentage was taken up by the election. Got the inside scoop on conventions from LL. 
* TTRPG with Rain City Reckoning: [Vials of Shit](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/rcr-htr-e14-vials-of-shit/), the ghost network, conversation about future sessions and games, sandbox versus modules. We're going to wrap up our [three year campaign](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/rain-city-reckoning/) of Hunter: the Reckoning this year. And then give _Fabula Ultima_ (2023) a shot next year, along with _Monty Python's Cocurricular Mediaeval Reenactment Programme_ (2023) one shots. I might even run _Delta Green_ (2015).

No notes this week.

## Book Reading

* Not a lot of reading this week. Checked out Geoff Johns' _Justice Society of America_... still don't really grasp all the characters in JSA. The Huntress and Per Degaton time-travel MECH is a cool way to introduce the audience to different eras of JSA.
* Found a copy of what I believe is my first comic ever. Wolverine #69.
* This week's pulls: _Absolute Batman_ is... Snyder totally understands how to be dumb, stupid cool. The puns, the action, the equipment is just so outrageous, it's cool. It's like Cloud's giant sword. It's like giant mecha robots. It's like bikini armor. It's like Power Girl's chest. It's like Sharknado or nnakes on a motherfucking plane. Snyder just knows how comics can be so stupid, it's cool, and Absolute Batman is just stupidly cool.
