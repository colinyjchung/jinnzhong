**Based on**: _Sinner, Baker, Fabulist, Priest; Red Mask, Black Mask, Gentleman, Beast_ by Eugie Foster - Source: no longer online, but is in [podcast](https://escapepod.org/2009/09/03/ep214/) form.

1. POV follows a strange, weird, or unusual routine, ritual, or process (MECH). It ends in a shocking way.
2. POV repeats MECH, but has an interaction with someone who breaks the rules of MECH.
3. POV experiences the best possible version of MECH, then next day, the worst possible version of MECH, and then yet another day, an iteration of MECH that goes unexpectedly, wherein the character from 2 breaks the rules of MECH in a much severe and drastic way.
4. Rules-breaker character onboards POV into "the resistance" against the ruling MECH, info-dump, secret location, the rules, and then gets killed.
5. POV is now part of "the resistance" and is a chaos agent in the world of MECH.
