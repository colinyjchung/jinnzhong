**Based on**: _A Witch's Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies_ by Alix Harrow - [source](https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/a-witchs-guide-to-escape-a-practical-compendium-of-portal-fantasies/)

1. POV runs a BUSINESS/PLACE where there are a lot of customer/user traffic. One user in particular is off (e.g. loner). They have a brief interaction.
   * POV recommends a MECH (sold/offered by BUSINESS/PLACE)
   * USER/CUSTOMER comes with someone else to BUSINESS/PLACE, reveals who they really are via the relationship
   * USER/CUSTOMER returns alone sad/feelings
3. POV reveals there's a secret stash of MECH (exclusive, limited, secret, magical, powerful, whatever). It can really help the USER/CUSTOMER, but there are strict rules for its use and would get POV in a lot of trouble.
4. USER/CUSTOMER does something that's a huge cry for help. POV recalls a similar situation where they didn't help and it ended badly (half-person died, injured, career ended). POV does something they're not supposed to do (a minor rule break).
5. USER/CUSTOMER vanishes (stops showing up) and POV freaks out, blaming themselves for repeating the same mistake, promises they'll break the rules of MECH to help. They do it and pay the consquences - but USER/CUSTOMER got the help they needed.
