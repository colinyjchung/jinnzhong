## Highlights This Week

* This week was much stronger in terms of "doing the work". After a lot of prework on the MINOS project, I did go into a bit of an archeological dig of my older notes on plotting. Most notably, ["The Twelve Sequences"](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/the-twelve-sequences-of-story-beta/). But also three entries on figuring out what I'm calling "Plot Beat Patterns": [part one](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-beat-patterns/), [part two](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/d20-of-plot-patterns/), and [part three](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/36-questy-middles/). I don't know if this will actually help me make the "context shift" from MECH-building to actual laying down plot, and then roughing it through dramatization. But we'll see.
* So I submitted that client project I complained about last week. It was done on Tuesday evening. I have forgotten about the high of sending in a completed project. It has been a while as I'm mostly managing and consulting these days. But what a euphroic thrill. The next day, I was like, _woooooo_ let's start twenty more new projects. It wasn't until an hour later, and after reflecting on the energy stuff I talked about [last week](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/2024-w06-eow-report/) that I realized... _holy fuck_, my head is messed up. I don't _actually_ have the energy to start _NEW SHIT_. WTF? I wonder if that successive, accretive finishing of projects and hunting client work was what drove my burnout post-2013.
* Waiting for Olivia to set up the Patreon and we'll be starting the podcast soon.

The John Cage ORGAN<sup>2</sup>/ASLSP story prompt from last week sent me down a winding road in my brain. I started with some surreal story idea from my childhood, and then shifted to a retelling of the Greek minotaur. I was struggling to go from idea and MECH-building to actual dramatization and plotting. Later, MRK assigned us thumbnails and retellings of Little Red Riding Hood. 

Thumbnails being 150 word "sketches" with beginnings, middles, and ends. Went on a bit of a rabbit hole there and ended up watching YT videos on artists talking about thumbnail sketches and how they used them. One [artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jghVE4V5FfU) talked about how he makes 50 thumbnail sketches for 1m each... then picks 5-6 and spend 10m on each of those... and finally 5 he spends another 20m on each.

My favorite thing MRK said last week (and paraphased/embellished here) was, "Artists doodle, musicians noodle, actors improv, so why don't writers fool around and make messy thumbnails?"

Project MINOS is coming along with the above in mind. I did end up spending Friday night doing more prework on my drive to my parent's house, talking to my iPhone... and then had a long convo via Signal with my brother I needed his expertise on.

## Daily Tracking

This will be the future space for tracking either daily time spent, or daily word count.

## EOW Time Tracking

I think in terms of work productivity... this was a solid week. After the [detoxing epiphany last week](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/2024-w06-eow-report/), I'm starting to feel my brain "empty out" better. I'm not chasing every minute with a distraction, I'm not filling every second with shopping for hobbies to escape, I'm not wishing I had more time to play this game or that RPG, or whatever. I am letting my brain get bored on purpose so I can let it breathe and noodle on storytelling.
So much so that I didn't read anything for two days and lost my Storygraph streak.

## Book Reading

* Finished  _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_ (1962). What a really, really _fucked up_ book. Five stars. In fact, I added the "6bat" tag to this book on StoryGraph. The "6bat" tag is reserved for "books I aspire to". See live commentary on _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_ [here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/commentary-we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle-1962/)
* OK, pledging wise, I couldn't help but back Leo Hunt's _The Shrike_ on Kickstarter. It looks so atmospheric and dark and beautiful. So, the spending fast continues, but the countdown has begun. Purple Planet funds on March 5, The Shrike on March 15. I don't think anything else will come up rest of the year. As Ogrebeef told me, most RPG publishers are holding back on this 50th anniversary of D&D. Why fight the elephant in the room? With that said, Pendragon 6e might go live this year, along with Ars Magica 5e redux for sure. I don't need rulesets, I know that.
* I am still wrestling with _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (1961). It is just so _rough_. I also started and quickly gave up on _The Bomber Mafia_ (2021). I love Gladwell's _Revisionist History_ podcast... and all his other books... but this, I dunno. I just don't know. I got through the audiobook intro, the prologue, and all this other stuff... and just found the first chapter... dry? Or I just wasn't in the right mood to start something new so quickly after _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_. That's probably more the case. Yesterday though, I got bumped up for a "cut the line" thing on Libby for Mary Beard's SPQR. I took it. The problem with Libby is I'm playing a game of timing holds. I have Obama's book _and_ the second Mistborn both arriving with an ETA of ~2 weeks... and they're both 29 hours long. I know I'll listen to _The Well of Ascension_ (2007) at 2.5X just like I did with _The Final Empire_ (2006)... but with _A Promised Land_ (2020), I'm not speeding up the president. _That's just disrespectful._ Obviously, none of this would an issue if I just started my Libro.fm membership. But I'm on this "spending fast", right? I have a long-ass wishlist of WW2 books on there.

[^1]: LEGEND for **Project Status Dashboard**

    * **prj** = project codename
    * **st** = start date
    * **dr** = 1st draft completed
    * **ed** = edits (before beta/crits) completed
    * **rv** = revisions (post-feedback) completed
    * **fn** = story (or chapter) finished
    * **sb** = submission process begins

[^2]: The most important objective of the **EOW Time Tracking** is to ensure that productive hours _are_ dedicated to actual fiction writing. This is to prevent excuses, distractions, and procrastination activities like... Using "I'm too busy with client work" as an excuse or doing unnecessary "fiction-related" activities (like consuming more craft education, excessive world-building research, and working on marketing stuff when I'm not even published yet!)
    
    LEGEND for **EOW Time Tracking**
    * F = Actual fiction writing work (drafting, editing).
    * X = Activities related to fiction, but not actual writing!
    * C = Paid client work.
    * P = Business related work.
