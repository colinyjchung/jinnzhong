The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_ (1962) by Shirley Jackson. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. 

## :warning: **SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** :warning:

* First 10-20%. What the hell is going on? Mary wants to see everyone dead. Mary is hated by all the villagers. Is it a commentary on wealth divide? I mean, they own a lot of land. So why do they go to the library? Wait. So there’s a tragedy in their family. Is Mary dead? Constance? Julian? Is one of them a ghost they interact with? Or is this just my stupid default theory for everything when it comes to mysteries because of stupid Fight Club and Sixth Sense?
* ~23%. Ooooooh. That’s fucked up. So now they just live on the house where it all happened despite the constant animosity? Is Julian giving a fucking ghost tour? Lol. Constance is literally in the next room dude. Wtf.
* Why would Uncle Julian say if he said the right lines? What are they hiding?
* 35%. Oops. Looked up the Wikipedia and found out who did it. That was stupid of me. I rarely do that. But then again, this audiobook is only 6 hours and I’m already two hours in after starting today (gym day).
* 43% JFC, Mary Kat is unstable as fuck.
* 48%? Charles shows up at around the midpoint driving the rest of the narrative to its end.
* 59% she’s going to kill him yes? I mean…  and also, who has spiced cookies for dinner?
* 61% or is she going to finish the job and kill everyone else?
* 64% what? I’m so confused. MK is dead according to Julian? What?
* 66% the delusional dinner. Holy fuck MK is really really insane isn’t she? Being in her head is horrifying.
* 72% heh. So it’s like The Lottery but with a house? haha
* 79% - Constance is in complete denial or has an optimist set point that’s extremely high
* End - yeah, what a fucked up book. Five stars and also tagging it as a [book I aspire to](https://app.thestorygraph.com/tags/0bcd5ef9-16dc-4ec7-bada-f7fa2ccef1c1). I was unhinged the entire read.
