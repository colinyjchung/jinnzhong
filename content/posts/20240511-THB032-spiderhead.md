**Based on**: _Escape from Spiderhead_ by George Saunders - source: _Tenth of December_ (2013)

1. POV is subject to a weird, unique, or sinister MECH (experiment, ritual, process). POV is monitored. MECH repeated and iterated for second time with more REVEAL.
2. The scientist, conductor, or priest gives POV a dilemma/decision regarding MECH
3. POV meets the other test subjects. Learns more about the experiments.
4. The scientist, conductor, or priest takes MECH to a darker level (for knowledge). POV refuses to participate. Scientist bribes, cajoles, and/or threatens POV until they get compliance. Something goes wrong. Another MECH and POV puts up more refusal.
5. POV escapes, commits suicide, or destroys stuff as a refusal to participate in MECH, or destruction of it.
