That’s a big fight between him and the brown girl. Pentle talks to him about the baby. How she didn’t know how to keep it quiet and that’s how the neighbors heard. They talk about how dumb this is. How foolish it is. They talk about how resourceful they are even though there isn’t a baby industry anymore. They talk about how the lack of evidence might let the girl off, but they have a high rate of recidivism. So it’s only a matter of time. Protagonist thinks about the concept of recidivism.

## 9 (~3500) CLIMAX: 
He slams the door in. She sees him and deflates. Not shocked or surprised. Just deflates. She knew he was coming. But then he starts asking questions. He’s breaking script. He’s sitting down and having a cigarette. The kid wanders up to her mom’s lap to nurse. He looks at her and talks about all he consequences of getting off rejoo to do it. He’s asking her why she does it. She doesn’t answer. He’s getting horny looking at her because she’s got that mom look, and the cigarette he’s smoking is obviously a penis metaphor because it grows grey and limp at one point and Bacigalupi is so obvious here and I’m surprised I didn’t notice the first 5 times I read it. The jungle is this fecund forceful nature of rebirth and breeding. C’mon Colin. How can you  miss it? Anyway. The kid stops feeding and takes his hat and wants to put it on him. It’s a game. Then she goes and plays blocks. Then the mom finally talks. She tell him that we need to do something new. She’s not selfish. She’s wakes up every morning and she sees life anew through her eyes and that’s worth everything to her. He tells the guy that he’s got dead eyes, they all have dead eyes and they wouldn’t understand. Then he offers his gun to her and taunts her. Do you want to shoot me? Would you kill one life for this other one? And she jumps at it, but he pulls it away and she’s heartbroken because this was her one and only chance. She put all her bets on it. And now she’s sobbing on her dirty kitchen table and her kid is bawling and the protagonist can shoot the kid, it’s a clear shot. But he doesn’t. Instead he walks outside, runs in the mud and feels the rain like it’s new again. 

Purpose: Wraps up several things: the obsession, he needs to resolve the big question of it bothering him. He needs to resolve that he’s found her. he needs to resolve this dead eyes thing. The limp cigarette and getting horny is part of him feeling that hunger for life but also how useless he’d become. He lets the woman at the gun and not care because he needs that adrenaline rush. He gets answer out of her for why they have babies.
