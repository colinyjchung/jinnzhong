**Based on**: _Cat Pictures Please_ by Naomi Kritzer - [source](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_01_15/)

1. POV is an entity/force/sentience that has access to a population segment and has power to nudge/affect them indirectly
2. POV talks about its origins, its observations of this segment, and the rules it follows for affecting them.
3. EXAMPLE 1 goes well, EXAMPLE 2 is a failure, EXAMPLE 3 makes POV mad because 3 is dumb and won't listen to all the signs/signals POV is feeding them.
4. POV hangs back and gives up trying to influence/manipulate the population segment, but comes across 2 who has improved due to POV's actions. Feels hopeful.
