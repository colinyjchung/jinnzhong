- Stealing and getting away with it
- Betting big and winning
- In the presence of mortal danger and surviving
- Catching someone in the act who's dangerous
- Spying on someone who's dangerous
- Talking about someone dangerous, mythical or powerful
- Dangerous person escapes
- Dangerous person gets caught and acts fine (mastermind)
- Being mistaken for someone else and you have to run now
- Cat & Mouse chases
- Not knowing what's been done to you (surgery, ritual, magic)
- Not knowing who's on your side, who's betrayed you, who's a plant
- Whistleblowing -- leading up to and the actual moment
- Finding out you're involved with much bigger forces than expected
- Finding out you're involved with something much more fucked up/disturbing
- Having your lie called out
- Having secrets revealed
- Almost getting betrayed and than betrayed
- Waiting for something, looking to act on it, but distracted by everyday life - mindless conversation.
- People milling about on everyday activity when audience knows something bad is coming (dread)
