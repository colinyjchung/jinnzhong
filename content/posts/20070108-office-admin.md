I have not written a damn word of Ishaq. I had not expected this weight to drop on me. All this office year-end stuff. Then there was the fact that I didn't have my sleeve yet, so I couldn't take my mac book with me. But that's a lame excuse for not writing. If I'm going to do that, I should also blame the terrible weather on Friday. Snow and rain and floods and trudging through three inches of water, while SUVs drove by me splashing puddles on my face. That day sucked. I was wet and cold and miserable. The only positive that came out of this week, in regards to my fledging career as a writer was my reading list. I now have two books completed on there. I will NOT buy books until I finish what's in my queue unless it is of the necessary non-ficiton kind... which ultimately means NONE.

I wish we won the lottery.
