Allies that are well-intentioned, or vulnerable and you want to help, or they offer help, but...

## Hard to Help Friends
* They're incompetent and make constant mistakes
* They lack self-awareness about their faults
* They lack social/political awareness and have gaffaws
* They're prickly/bristly and particular about things
* They think they're helping but are actually causing more problems via side effects
* They are malcontent
* Their problem (fear/anxiety) is too great
* They need to solve it themselves and you can only lead them to water
* They are constantly playing the victim card
* They can't stop making things worse
