I guess this is part three of my [plot beat patterns](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-beat-patterns/) analysis in a way. After creating a [d20 list of Disruptions](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/d20-of-plot-patterns/)(aka inciting incidents / DSRs), I started thinking more about the "middles". Middles is where after the DSR, the PROT has to actually _do something_, the "quest" so to speak. The DSR upsets the STS, which forces the PROT to react with a "quest" in the most broadest of terms. You could just call it a job, task, assignment too I suppose. The doing of this quest is the PROT's attempt to solve the problem caused by the DSR.
