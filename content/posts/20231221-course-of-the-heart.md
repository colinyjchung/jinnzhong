The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _The Course of the Heart_ (1992) by M. John Harrison. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. 

:warning: **SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** (_obviously_). :warning:

* nothing’s happening. It’s just bunch of sad people being sad because they did something twenty years ago and they can’t even remember what it is they did. and the prose isn’t that amazing either as i was promised. It’s not workmanlike but it’s not beautiful either. 
* Pg. 50 is this a magical negro thing? Narrator has one write him a note. Pam is wondering who took her picture at the convalescent and it’s a black man.
* wait a minute. What the fuck is the narrator’s name? Does he exist? I mean, if Pam, Lucas, and Yaxley are hallucinating and/or living in some imaginary world… did they make up the narrator too?
