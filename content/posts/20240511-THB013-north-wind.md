**Based on**: _As the North Wind Howled_ by Yu Hua - [source](https://www.newyorker.com/books/flash-fiction/as-the-north-wind-howled)

1. POV going about routine day when interrupted and told they were expected for a task/job/assignment/obligation/event MECH. (Could be a case of mistaken identity, gaslight, or bureacratic mess).
2. POV confused, fact-checks, fights with messenger, reluctance, and finally acceptance, and goes with the messenger to MECH
3. POV arrives and the stakes are higher AND everyone has a vague familiarity with POV. POV plays along and is roped in and finally accepts the responsibilities of MECH and its ongoing maintenance.
