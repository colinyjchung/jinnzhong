**Based on**: _Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience<sup>tm</sup>_ by Rebecca Roanhorse - [source](https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/welcome-to-your-authentic-indian-experience/)

1. POV provides a "wish-fulfillment" experience, service, and/or product that customers love (but POV wants to do something more "real"). Boss shuts this down.
2. POV does job (the MECH), and they believe they are doing a routine job that's great, but the customer isn't buying this time. USER/CUSTOMER wants to quit. POV tries to salvage it.
3. USER/CUSTOMER shows up outside of work, breaking protocol (USERS of MECH do not communicate with the PROVIDERS, or POV in this case). But POV needs a connection outside of MECH.
4. USER and POV meet outside of MECH (breaking protocol), but they connect at a human level. They talk.
5. Due to REASONS, USER/CUSTOMER slowly infiltrates the POV's social circle, becomes better liked, then into the MECH workplace, takes their job, and finally, takes over the POV's home.
