I was a sore loser when I was five. I remember crying over a game of *Don't Talk to Strangers* (1984). It's hilarious if you think about it.

My earliest boardgame memories include playing a lot of *Mastermind* (1971), *Chinese Checkers* (1893), *Chinese Chess* (762), *Cribbage* (1630) and *Animal Chess* with a family friend. I distinctly remember my father breaking open a copy of  *Monopoly* (1935) at some house party,  not explaining the rules well, and me refusing to buy anything except railroads. I lost, obvs.

My first wargame wasn't chess. It was *Lu Zhan Jun Qi*, a Stratego-like game. My brother sucked at it because I lied better. Oh and *Battleship* (1931) too. I guess that's why I'm in marketing and advertising now.

The first game changer (pun intended) for me, though... like many kids that grew up in the 80s, was Milton Bradley's *HeroQuest* (1989). I spent more time designing dungeons than playing. It was also my first taste as a dungeon master. Never split the party!

November 2002 was when I discovered modern designer board games. Forgot why I was in North Vancouver, but wandered into Checkpoint Charlie's Games on 2nd Street E, and got a copy of *Carcassonne* (2000). After that, *Settlers of Catan* (1995), *Puerto Rico* (2002), *El Grande* (1995), *Tigris & Euphrates* (1997), *Traders of Genoa* (2001), *Acquire* (1964) and *Fluxx* (1997) went into heavy rotation. There was also that one New Year's Eve we played *Illuminati: New World Order* (1994) and never again. (Don't ask). These games were all we had in the early-aughts.

## I've Seen This Niche Hobby Explode For 20+ Years

It is unrecognizable. Y'all buncha spoiled kids with your Kickstarters,  miniatures, expensive luxury tables, and a BGG database with 100,000+ games.

BGG, incidentally, is  my 2nd oldest online account I still have access to (Dec. 15, 2002). [Here's my profile](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yuet-jinn).

Took a hiatus  2007-2014. Marriage, mortgage, kids, laid off in '09 from eBay, launched my freelancing career. Came back in 2015 to see the hobby expand even further.

## The Heavy Board Game Club + BGG 100

Between 2016-2020, my brother and I ran a monthly "Heavy Board Game Club". We had two concurrent tables and at its peak, up to twelve attendees in a townhouse. If you want to do this yourself, you can steal my "[constitution](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/heavy-board-game-club-constitution/)" here. Running a club like this requires a lot of rules and logistics.

Made a concerted effort to play the [top 100 games on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) despite the fact it updates all the time. Think I got to 62 or 64 at one point. It's down to 50 now. I refuse to play *Gloomhaven* (2017) and *Pandemic Legacy* (2015). First off, co-op. What's that? I want to beat my opponents into mush, not make friends with them. Secondly, salty they knocked *Twilight Struggle* (2005) off its throne. That's a real game. (Yes, I gatekeep).

My favorite games during this "renaissance/2015 return": *Through the Ages* (2015), *Food Chain Magnate* (2015), *Gaia Project* (2017), *Terraforming Mars* (2016), *The Gallerist* (2015), *Orléans* (2015), *Grand Austria Hotel* (2015), *Five Tribes* (2014), *Alchemists* (2014), *Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar* (2012), and *Teotihaucan* (2018).

Looking back -- I'm realizing 2015 was an inflection point in this niche hobby. Not unlike what 1999 was for the film world.

My pandemic games were *Castles of Burgundy* (2011) and *Potion Explosion* (2015) with 80 games logged from June-October 2020 on [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/). lol. My second most logged game is *Pax Pamir: 2E* (2019). Hurray for Tor at [Rally the Troops](https://rally-the-troops.com/)!

## Hex & Counters + Historical Wargames

More and more, I'm moving away from Euros that are basically "simultaneous solitaire". I think I've had my share of worker placement as a mechanic. There's just been too many games where I ignored everyone, focused on my own engine, and  won the game. I prefer interaction, and head-to-head conflict. Asymmetrical? Even better.

So it shouldn't surprise you, these days -- I'm getting into the highest level of boardgame nerdom... hex-and-counters (and historical wargames)... games with 40+ page rule books, hundreds of components, and "[weight scores](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight)" of 4.00+.

It helps these games are based on actual  battles in history, an interest of mine I've put off for too long until now.
