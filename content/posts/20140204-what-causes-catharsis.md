## Keys to Heartwrenching Moments

- When hero finally realizes the sacrifice others made for them
- When bad guy reveals his need for "home" as the reason for his evil acts
- When people react to death of someone who was DEEPLY IN their lives (someone who provided sanctuary)
- When people drop their act and be authentic with someone they've been ignoring or treating wrong
- When the hero acts brave against overwhelming odds, even as it's killing him inside
- When the hero goes against the norm, goes into uncertainty, and risk for someone else.
- Realizing too late that someone you love has grown up or grown old
- Realizing that innocent time you took for granted is passed
