What is a **Role-Playing Game?** (RPG)

A role-playing game (RPG) is where a bunch of people sit around a table and tell a story together, but with rules and dice.

One person acts as a “**dungeon master**” (DM) or **referee**. This person describes the setting, side characters and events.

Everyone else are **player characters** (PCs). They react to the situations thrown at them by saying what they want to do and roll dice to find out if they succeed.

Put simply...

1. The DM describes a scene.
2. Players decide (and declare) what their character does.
3. They roll dice to see if it works.
4. DM describes the consequences.
5. Rinse and repeat.

## What Kind of Stories are Told?
There are a lot of RPG settings out there. 

* There's fantasy (like Game of Thrones).
* There's space opera (like Star Wars).
* There's investigative horror (like X-Files).
* There's cyberpunk (like Blade Runner).
* There's one where you play incompetent criminals like a Coen Brothers flick.
* There's even one based on Mexican soap operas!

*Buuuut...* the first (and most popular) RPG of all time is Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

In D&D, the players are "adventurers" seeking treasure in a fantasy setting (castles, dragons, and magic spells).

## What is an Adventurer?

While "modern" D&D is about heroes saving the universe from evil villains...

I like to run my games the "old school" way.

Old School D&D is where adventurers are misfits, outcasts and scoundrels who can’t get a “regular” job in the feudal system and have resorted to...

* Robbing graves with deadly traps
* Treasure hunting in abandoned ruins
* Stealing from dragons and powerful wizards
* Chasing rumors of secret caches of wealth
* Hunting monsters for money

In other words, this is high-risk work done by desperate people for high-rewards.

It also makes for sillier game where players can die in dumb ways. Which I love. And why I keep a running tally of all the PCs I've killed.

But players can also play smart and survive!
