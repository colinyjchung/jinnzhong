**Based on**: _Taylor Swift_ by Hugh Behm-Steinberg - [source](http://gulfcoastmag.org/journal/28.2/2015-barthelme-prize-winner-taylor-swift/)

1. POV orders strange/weird MECH/ITEM because someone they're interested in/in-love-with also has that MECH/ITEM
2. POV exploits/uses MECH in an unconventional, mysterious way (don't explain to the audience). POV sets up a meetup with crush
3. POV arrives at meetup but can't execute the plan (with the MECH). Makes a pass instead and they get together.
