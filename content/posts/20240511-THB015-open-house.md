1. POV is an inanimate object/place who's been abandoned for a while, but due to EVENT, it will get visitors today and one of them will claim POV. Also, POV can affect things to a degree.
2. The future owner(s) appear. One of them doesnt believe in magic (e.g. what POV affects).
3. Future owner(s) explore, POV interacts, future owners are hesitant, POV shows off an unexpected magic (an ace in the sleeve), but "amazing magic" accidentally hurts one of the future owner(s). Something is dropped/left. Future owner(s) leave.
4. POV is sad and dejected until future owner(s) come back to retrieve dropped item/thing. POV realizes the "secret need" of the owner. Owner reconsiders the object/place and purchases/obtains POV.
