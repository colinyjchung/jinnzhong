* Mountain Peak - legendary creature crashed into mountain. Snowy, windswept border between Colvand Empire and Nemean League. House Clemens (Astoria) North and House Sabine (Effinger) South.
* Touch the aether. Stand in front of Aether Whale. It is injured. Spenser pets it, it's getting colder, shivering. Spenser feeds the creature a remedy. Tsumi is building a fire while Sebastian does absolutely fucking nothing.
* Tsumi knows Sebastian is Gnosis. But they keep his anonymity in unspoken terms.
* Tsumi and Gnosis have insighted that there might be a mountain with steam coming out. Possibly a fire spirit. Something that could help keep the whale warm.
* Captain Skyblade stays sentry next to the whale. Spenser continues to talk to it to comfort it.
* Tsumi and Gnosis enter this cave. It's warm. Magma lights up the cave. Steam coming out of this crevice. Small lights dancing around this crack.
* There are two wolves sleeping by this crevice. Tsumi comes up with the idea for Sebastian to use fire magic to attract the fire spirits elsewhere. Sebastian rolls a crit. Ball of flame appears in Sebastian's hands. Dancing spirits comes towards the ball of flame.
* Fire spirits radiate and dancing around the whale.
* Skyblade knows of a village of healers that's nearby, as told to them by the otters. Healers in village are being reticent. Not willing nor eager to help. They enter the mead hall and it appears they've helped Colvand soldiers. Elders say they are currently predisposed.
* Tsumi is going to fold time and make the Colvand soldiers to fall asleep and pass out. Tsumi pictures a clock with a finger moving the hands until they get conked out and fall asleep.
* Healers are thankful that this was done. They're out there these Colvands. Gather up the sisters and healers.
* Arriving at the whale. Three healers. Applying salves and doing ritual magick. Whale starts stirring. Deep hum shakes the snow. Spenser understands what the whale is saying.
* Whale says: we're all in danger. The authors (the moon aliens) that taught magick... Gods to this world... danger. Had to warn. Spenser can we help? Home gone. Is the aether breaking apart. Other whales? Lost and alone. Are you the last? Don't know. No one for centuries. Swimming alone in aether for centuries? Aehter attacks. Must warn mages. Whale recognizes Tsumi's medallion. Mages must come home.
* Nemean League would be all political intrigue. Meggido (cat people) would be the best to help with this whale. Does Gnosis know anything?
* Four archmages including Tsumi. Definitely Megiddo has one. One for each corner in the world. One in Colvand? One in Asuria Protectorate (farming place). McHayley the magical figure.
* Can we move the whale? Can we hide it? Can we heal it until it can fly again. Spenser will travel back to Effinger to talk to Cid, the master of airships. And get an airship to move the whale. Village to keep healing while they're unconscious.
* Shipyard. Large complex in flatland area. Industrial place. Charged by magitek and wind spirits. Does float off if not tied down. Good sized town. Airship town. Most people work as engineers and builders. Three hangars. Effinger exports airships. Cid builds them. We then cargo hauler. Over Bermuda Triangle.
* Astoria only has one port in the capital. Cid would like to open another port near the border of the other nations. Get Astoria to fund a port in Northwestern. We need to get whale further down mountain. We need a place to put the whale. Can't use Kemes. Isle of Sunken Moon is actually sunk. Tartarus is neutral. Is it Switzerland.
* Are we rolling a whale down the mountain on logs? Tsumi finds a path that's wide enough. The Free Willy Clock. Abraxos is the name. Spenser hires a workforce. We're going to make a harness and use logs to roll the whale down. Sebastian uses book knowledge to help construct the contraption.
