## Anti-Goal Cycling

* So... I don't have anything for Snyder and it's Saturday night as I type this. I waffled between something Tarot, something rough for [prj: MERCI](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-merci/) converted. But now also have something due for Rambo's ASSW next Monday. Might just start on that CD shop idea.
* What ended up happening this week anyway? I know I didn't do as much mountain dialect. I think I thought through some of the Tarot stuff and I started looking into how tank platoons are structured. Oh right. I skimmed quickly through Rick Priestly's 1987 first edition of _Warhammer 40K_ rules to see if there are stuff to pull out, then skimmed even faster through _Lancer_ (2019). Both did not have what I really needed and now I'm realizing how utterly wrong and horrible that premise I had years ago that sourcebooks could be pillaged for story ideas is. It's just not... meaty enough. There are not enough characters to steal from and even worldbuilding is useless because while I can make sly references, I still need to do the work myself to build it out for myself. And the other revelation this week is that this is not helpful for writing stories _now_ which is what I want to do... every world I want to write in requires a lot of research, so I need to focus. I'm already deep into 16th Century Renaissance/Reformation stuff, so let's just stick to that. Then I listed out the worlds I know myself that I can get away with. I think generic pseudo-medieval fantasy and urban fantasy is probably easy enough for me, but feels really tropey. 
* I think I need to adjust this game again. Maybe 30m research somewhere somehow... but 30 minutes actual drafting of scenes. I think what's frustrating is the scenes are not preloaded and ready to go in a backlog. I need to think through this more. I need story PROGs that I'm comfortable just storycrafting in. So my of writing stories is getting into character, and getting into character is researching lingo, slang, and accents... and then the mechanisms of their world.

* Monday was moving day. Shook out the rug, vacuumed, dragged couch, shelves, swept and dust. Setting up the monitor arm only to discover that my current Samsung VESA is not compatible or missing some part or another. Still want a second monitor. Could be excuse to. Cleared out a stack of books. Monday night, drove to IKEA to get KALLAX compatible inserts. Two double-drawers, one with a door. Basically a snack box high up and sealed tight, so no mice can get in. At least I don't think so. Reduced number of toys and junk on top of said bookshelves, have them facing outward now, as next to glass wall. It's a cosy set up. No second desk as anticipated. But saving money. Monday night was bad attempt at those KALLAX shelves, Tuesday brought in actual tools and got that done.
* Wednesday stayed late for reviews? No Thursday. After an important call with Client A's CEO and COO. Lots of walking afterwards around the block. Middle one science fair on Friday. I wanted to read their poster boards without them talking to me even though I know that's not the implicit bargain of these things. Eldest grilled four. Youngest had birthday dinner on Tuesday. I'm all over the place. Friday night, pho after science fair. Tried a hot and sour seaweed noodle soup. Right. Middle one's project was on gambling at the poster board was a stand out homage to Las Vegas with lights.


## Story Introspection
* Officially dropping JSA, Poison Ivy, and Batgirl. Phoenix next week. Several miniseries wrapping up over the next two months as well. Want to get under 30 titles if at all possible. Realize X-men franchise except for the three main titles and Storm is basically spaghetti on wall and I've had enough. NYX is ending too I guess. Make way for Imperial. Standouts this week? Ram V., of course. 
* Tanith Lee's _"A Hero at the Gates"_ (1979) was fun. Reading the original James Thruber _"Secret Life of Walter Mitty"_ (1939) was also fun.
* A lot of TV to catch up on. Yellowjackets (2021) Season 3, White Lotus (2021) Season 3, Wheel of Time (2021) Season 3, Severance (2022) Season 2, Andor (2022) Season 2.
