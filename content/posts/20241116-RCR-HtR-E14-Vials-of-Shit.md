## Story Session

* Evening in the fall. George and Kassie at funeral parlour. Sam and James back at warehouse. George is watching Terrifier. Kassie on phone surfing TikTok. Doorbell rings. Neighbors across the street. Mr. and Mrs. Butler. Empty nesters. Boring. Retired. Pauses at the hacksaw scene. Offers drink. They want champagne. Mrs. Butler gets up in my face. Kassie gets up to get her rifle. Butler grilling George. Kassie heads over to the Mrs. They're thinking George is lying. They're threatening us. Trickle of blood down nose. Kassie blows a hole in her head. Mr. Butler tries to strangle, George dodges. George unsettled by gun shot and body hitting floor. Two voices out of Mr. Butler's mouth... "GIve me the Watch!". Kassie runs over, couch slides in front of my way, Kassie attempts to jump over it, fails, falls into the couch, other objects in the room are now hovering as if ready to hit Kassie. George grabs knife to slice. Kassie jumps behind the couch, but a flower pot still gets her. George runs towards where Kassie is. We both run out of the house. Kassie managed to get out of the house. House is barred. George runs for the door. Kassie calls James and Sam. Kassie runs to backdoor, opens it, calls to George. George has poltergeist hands grabbing her and pulling her up, hears whistling in the distance. Some old song. "She's not there" by the Hollies. Kassie goes into kitche and sees George is held and hovering. Clothes being wrinkled. Kassie talks to the ghost? Words fall on deaf ears, cold silence. George senses four spirits holding her. Wrapped around her. Trying to grab the watch. Singularly focused on the watch. Kassie can see watch moving. Tries to grab it. Spirit hand is now on my hand.
* Cops are rushing towards George's house as Sam is going to gun it. James says, I know side streets. Let's go. Sam and James get to the back of the house. We can all hear the sirens. George collapses to the floor. Kassie running with George's watch. Kitchen products are now flying at all four of us. Chair hits Sam in the back. All four get in the car. Kassie hands watch back to George. Kassie deletes videos. Hands murder weapons to James to get rid of evidence. What can we do? Do we have alibis? Get Jing on the phone? James calls him to be lead detective?
* Neighbors heard loud noise. Called cops. They can't enter. They don't have cause to go into the house. Can Jing get rid of them. Patrols go away.
* George calls Franco. Tell me what the fuck is going on. Panics at him. Why house. Why watch. What the fuck is going on. Why after my house. Kassie takes George's phone, threatens Franco. I got info. I have your address. Franco is intimidated. Will come over with necromancer in three hours. Don't say "necromancer" over the damn phone. Don't say "clean up bodies" either! Let's go get schwarma, Kassie says.
* We're in Sam's car. It's awkward. Waiting for the black sedan to pull up. Franco comes out, dressed up. Other guy is the ritual person in the video. Dressed in expensive Armani suit. Black slick hair. Pale and tall and burly. Has a briefcase. Talking to Franco. Companion one step behind him. Alphonse. He doesn't speak English. Says our first and last names. Alphonse has a low, gravelly, Italian dialect you've never heard of before. You have haunted house. We wanted it. You didn't give it up. Now you have haunted house you can't live in. Reveals grandfather is in the watch. You've experienced a corrupted version of what Orpheus did. Now there are malevolent ghosts. It was never malicious before. Can you open a portal for us to go through. George can go through portal. Kassie can't go with George. 
* They are impressed with Kassie's hacking job. Kassie asks if she's offered a job. She gets employment.
* We have a deal. Acquisitions Inc. will pay George for the house. Let her have five million. And go with her through the portal. George goes with Alphonsei into the haunted house. Sees dead body, "this is good work". Unbuttons shirt. He is bizarrely alluring and handsome. Cracks knuckles. Dirty fingernails. Books and vials of shit. Sit down. Gives Alphonse the watch. Speaks in latin - forwards/backwards. All of a sudden - silence. Can't hear outside street. Alphonse taps George. George opens eyes. Decayed version of house. Energy around sigil is pushing around shadows. See four figures. Teeth and multiple eyes. No legs. withered bits. Danger. Spectres. Focuses on watch. Grandfather comes out. Dressed like an older explorer, like when he was twenties. Motorcycle goggles. Sees George and necromancer. Grandfather says sorry. Alphonse speaks to him in Italian. Grandfather sees enemies. George catches a few words. Alphonse says "work". Going to make place safe for Grandpa. Grandpa tells George it's going to be OK. Time to let me go. Tell your brother not to be such a prick. Do what Alphonse says. George closes eyes. Alphonse blows out candles. finito. Kassie comes into to grab her stuff. Watching us the entire time. Packing and gathering stuff. Business transaction is concluded.
* Threatens us again. Don't deal with us. 
* Network of ghost spies. 
* All of us are sleeping at the warehouse. Exhausted. Outside of fence, five sets of glowing eyes in the dark. Five wolves sitting outside perimeter staring at the warehouse.
