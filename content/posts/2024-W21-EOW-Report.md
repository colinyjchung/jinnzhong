## Highlights This Week

* Finally finished working on the [story tags](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/still-brainstorming-story-tags/). On a rational level, I know it was procrastination. On a psychological level, I know it was insecurity. On a physical level, I know I'm recovering from exhaustion. So while one part of me wants to feel bad for not pushing through on actual fiction work... a larger part of me is OK with what happened. Perhaps this is maturity or old age or wisdom. I dunno.
* Lost my reading streak on Storygraph after crashing on Monday. 85 Days of 40pgs. min. You could argue that _Sense and Sensibility_ broke me.
* Long convo with LK on Signal processing the last 5 years/15 years/life.

ZERO PROGRESS this week!!! Was working on [this](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/still-brainstorming-story-tags/)

## EOW Time Tracking

In this section, I track daily actions (axn) and emotions (emo), aiming for just 30 minutes of fiction work a day. If time permits, more is done. AXN emoji legend in footnote[^2].

| day | axn | emo | ntes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| SUN | :skull: | :thinking: | Stuck in theory spiral. |
| MON | :skull: | :weary: | Exhausted, run down. |
| TUE | :skull: | :weary: | Exhausted, run down. |
| WED | :skull: | :thinking: | Felt better, but still working on [story tags](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/still-brainstorming-story-tags/). |
| THU | :skull: | :thinking: | Really thought I'd be done by now. But no. |
| FRI | :skull: | :thinking: |  Thought I could wrap up INQ tags, but woke up late. |
| SAT | :skull: | :thinking: | Thought I could wrap up INQ at car appointment, but had other errands. |

**STREAK COUNT:** 0 Days

**BEST STREAK:** 18 Days

## Four Thousand Weeks

| 1743/4000 | <div style="width:200px;height:15px;background:#AAAAAA;border:1.3px solid #000000;"><div style="width:43.575%;height:15px;background:#006600;font-size:12px; color:white; line-height:12px;">43.575%</div></div> |

The rundown exhaustion continued on Monday and Tuesday. I was worn down at the office and could barely function but still pushed through. I lost my daily book reading streak. I set it as 40 pages a day on Storygraph 85 days ago. I remember pushing myself to get through _Sense and Sensibility_ on Monday night and my body just broke. It wasn't just the exhaustion though, it's a combination of that plus both _Sense and Sensibility_ and _How the Crusades Changed History_ being mediocre or slow, or I dunno. Just not into it. 85 days is a pretty good run though. Energy levels came back for Wednesday. Started feeling a little more confident at the full-time contract too. Thursday night - jammed with C-Chord. Friday, they introduced me to _Jujutsu Kaisen_ (2020- ). 

Long convo with LK on Signal Saturday morning -- processing everything that happened with the toxic client the last three years and why I stayed, and expanded to my marriage, where I'm at in my life/career, and we both came to interesting conclusions about where we were in life, what we valued, what tradeoffs I accepted. Something I've been thinking a lot about over the last few months since I listened to _The Vietnam War: An Intimate History (2017)_ is how I wouldn't be in Canada had that not happened. Just a cruel string of butterfly effects. What so many people in my family gave up. Two uncles, their lives.

So I finally replaced the New Balance trainers I bought back in 2004 when I read _Body for Life_ (1999). So discounting those two years I actually trained (2004-2005), and when I finally started going to the gym (2017-present)... That's 3X/week use for about eight years? RR laughed at them when he found out they shoes were almost as old as he was, then kept laughing as the shoelaces fell part, then the soles. I mean. It _is_ funny. Twenty years is a pretty damn good run (pun intended). Fuck you, planned obsolescence! I'm driving my 2010 Prius until it completely breaks down on the side of a highway leaving me stranded and needing to call BCAA.

## Book Reading

* Still thinking about _Never Let Me Go_ (2005). Posted my [breakdown here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/study-never-let-me-go-2005/). I also took [extensive notes on the middle, part 2](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/the-best-middle-ever/). The more I think about it, the more perfect this middle is to me. It builds momentum and mysteries leading up to it, they go to Norfolk, they answer a bunch of questions, and open up one last and big one for part 3. It really is perfection.
* At 70% mark for _Sense and Sensibility_ (1811). I'm... bored with this one. The Dashwoods are basically Mrs. Jenning's hostages being dragged around while the men around them are playas - intentional or unintentional. There's very little forward momentum, whereas _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813) has the mystery of Mr. Darcy vs. Wickham. I just need to get this done so I can move on.
* Almost done Great Courses _How the Crusades Changed History_ (2013). Read another chapter of _Directing the Story_ (2008) by Francis Glebas. Listening to BBC's version of _Hamlet_ (1601) where Michael Sheen plays the Prince of Denmark and I keep asking myself why Tony Blair is pretending to act like a deranged maniac. I guess to my kids' generation, he's Aziraphale. But he'll always be Tony Blair to me.

[^1]: LEGEND for **Project Status Dashboard**

    * **P** = priority (limit to 3 projects at any given time)
    * **prj** = project codename
    * **st** = start date
    * **fd** = 1st draft completed
    * **ed** = edits (before beta/crits) completed
    * **rv** = revisions (post-feedback) completed
    * **xd** = current draft being worked on

[^2]: The most important objective of the **EOW Time Tracking** is to ensure that hours dedicated to  fiction writing actually move stories forward for just thirty minutes a day minimum. It is also to ensure "fiction-related" activities (like consuming more craft education, excessive world-building research, and working on marketing stuff) doesn't count.
