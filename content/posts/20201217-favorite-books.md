In a conversation with K.D., we asked each other what our top ten non-work books were. That is, books which had nothing to do with marketing, business, or self-help.

Here's mine, in no particular order:

* Cloud Atlas (2004) by David Mitchell
* Skinny Legs and All (1990) by Tom Robbins
* Snow Crash (1992) by Neal Stephenson
* Interpreter of Maladies (1999) by Jhumpa Lahiri
* Pump Six and Other Stories (2008) by Paulo Bacigalupi
* The Cartel (2015) by Don Winslow
* Shogun (1975) by James Clavell
* The Crimson Petal and the White (2002) by Michael Faber
* Strangers in Their Own Land (2016) by Arlie Hochschild
* What the Dog Saw (2009) by Malcolm Gladwell
