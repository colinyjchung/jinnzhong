I'm still thinking about the middle (or part two) of _Never Let Me Go_ (2005) after re-reading it for a second time. A lot of storytellers complain about how difficult the middle is. But with this novel, I feel like Ishiguro has written one of the best novel middles ever. A lot of my thoughts on it feel a little scattered and halfway there right now though, so I'm going to try and formalize (or memorialize) it all with a proper analysis here. Let's start with a table.

Some notes before I start. Chapter 6 is in Part 1. Chapter 10 is when Part 2 starts. Chapter 12-15 is where the threaded setup-payoffs really kick into overddrive. And also...

:warning: **SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** (_obviously_). :warning:

|12|p.139|48%| Yes, clones. Intro "possibles" | [inq: RUMOR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-rumor/) D |
|13|p.153|53%| Intro concept of "deferrals" | [inq: RUMOR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-rumor/) E |
|14|p.156|54%| Spy on "possible" | Close [inq: RUMOR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-rumor/) D |
|14|p.166|58%| Ruth mono: "we are trash" | Build [inq: MISBEHAVE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-misbehave/) C |
|15|p.171|59%| Finds lost tape | Close [inq: RUMOR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-rumor/) A | 
|15|p.174|60%| Art gallery theory | Build [inq: RUMOR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-rumor/) E |
|15|p.174|60%| Porn mag theory | Close [inq: MISBEHAVE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq-misbehave/) C |

So in effect, Ishiguro closes three setups in this middle: 
* A - the lost tape ended up in Norfolk after all
* C - Tommy figures out Kath's porn obsession, riffling through them instead of using it for arousal
* D - The possible is confirmed, then denied. From exhilaration, to Ruth dragging it out, to disappointment in the art gallery

B and E is left hanging for Part 3.

I think what's utterly fascinating is how, really, all these threads peak from chapters 12-15. Just 35ish pages.

I suppose there's also a thread I failed to include here too... the love triangle where Ruth proactively keeps Tommy away from Kath. That's a [ntw: WIELD](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-wield/) thread there that I could probably breakdown as well.
