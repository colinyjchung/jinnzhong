## Anti-Goal Cycling

* This week was mostly [prj:ATOMS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-atoms/). I spent Wednesday and Friday figuring out the science/mech. Went down a HUGE rabbit hole. Wednesday was the initial Wikipedia and article reading while taking notes on a Midori A4... then Friday morning was thinking through it all to see how it could work, ended up with a CMX and DNM. Not written down, but it's pretty solid in my head.
* Tuesday was a mini-critique where we only shared positive feedback. Went well. I shared the first thirteen lines of [prj:BOXED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-boxed/). Two lines of dialogue in iambic hexameter. Some nice free indirect speech as well.
* Still reading _Vermeer's Hat_ (2007). My audiobook library copy of _The Six Wives of Henry VIII_ (1991) expired and five other people had holds on it. Oh well. Not in a hurry. Was mostly just passively listening anyway. Enjoying Matthew Gabriele's _American Medieval Podcast_, paid for the ad-free version. Hey, question: how do you know you're listening to history as done by legit historians? Answer: They spend 60-70% of the time talking about historiography instead of the actual history. Bada-tssss.

* It's getting to the end of the year. I did a lot of reflection the past month or so, setting goals for 2026 and beyond. The five year Hobonichi Techo. There are potential paths for victory/exits in sight, which as I'm marching slowly towards 45 seems almost unbelievable. I even put together a retrospective for the last three years, from when I journaled about _Four Thousand Weeks_ on March 7, 2023 to the present date. One of the most obvious insights in hindsight was how batshit insanely fast and busy the last two years went. I journaled about it in May of 2024, how I'd been running on adrenaline for two months since losing that retainer in March 2024, and then landing the new position. But as I look back at this year and everything that's happened, I see now that this year was just as fast-paced at an almost unsustainable speed. I kept joking with a colleague that this year was a revolution per quarter. I... got that. The Manila Trip, the WhatsApp Splinter, the Removal, and then the Ultimatum/Split. One revolution per quarter. Looking at 2024, after the trip to Iceland, there was The Day of Butchering and the Winter Project as well. AND SO -- with all that in mind, I'm realizing one particular behavior I've had the past few months -- where at the end of the day, I'm lowkey watching AGT Golden Buzzers and crying my eyes out in my sad little office -- doing this inexplicable thing to just feel human for a few minutes at the end of a really really long exhausting day... it _kinda makes sense now_. I haven't been on an adrenaline sprint from March to May 2024... I've been on an adrenaline-induced slow panic attack _marathon_ from March 2024 to October 2025. That's a TWENTY MONTH MARATHON.
* But starting in October, because of these Quarterly Revolutions, because there's more stability now, because we've removed the toxic chaos and now it's just regular normal chaos... I have had time to finally slow down, breathe, and reflect. And journal in a way that's not rushed or these weekly rhythm ones. And what I've been the last several weeks for most of November is introspective and baseline melancholic. I'm anxious in a different way now. I'm sighing and feeling empty and sad and love songs hit me harder. Some I'm listening to on repeat. There's a vacuum. That's what it is, and I there are a hundred small voices screaming at me to distract myself, to pick something else up, to go down another rabbit hole, to pick up a new distraction... but in this new quiet, this new state, I finally have the strength to say no and simply SIT with the EMPTINESS and be OK with it. To just be me again. And the me I'm seeing is this latent-romantic, this idealist, this philosophically-inclined day-dreaming emotionally-driven... artist/intellectual. I can hear myself again. I'm not running and running and treading water to protect myself and not feeling any safety at all.
* Which leads me to think about the "periods" in my life again. The eBay Era 2003-2009, the Freelancer Launchpad 2009-2012, the Desert 2013-2017, the AJM/PHC Pandemic 2018-2023. But more importantly, the widening concentric circles. It feels like 2015-2022 was a period of recapturing all the childhood things I never got to do because I grew up poor. So surgically extracting this period from ages 11-14 and then extrapolating it to that seven year period in my adulthood where I had money. And if that's the case, if that's truly what's happening, that I'm taking a cross-section, or a biopsy of a brief, intense period of my developing years and then enlarging it to examine, expand, and escalate, then what's coming -- assuming it's chronological -- the 15-19yo period is primed for where I'm heading: leveraging all I have left to push my literary career forward. This was the period where I wrote poetry, composed songs, played the melancholic bard dressed all in black: turtlenecks, long coats, Doc Martens boots.
* This is all made-up theory obviously. But it's compelling, isn't it? What if that's what's going on? What if it _is_ cyclical and I'm regressing, but progressing at the same time? What if.
* Still no M809. Where is my expensive gift to myself? Are the Germans taking their damn time to perfect it? Fine. That is a perfectly good reason for the wait then.

## Story Introspection

* Wrapped up the first arc of _The Count of Monte Cristo_ (1844). I'm making up the arcs since they don't actually exist, but chapters 1-13 seems like a good first arc. It's the 10% mark and the whole premise of the novel is set up with a slow-mo montage ending. And earlier on Saturday, broke into arc two and it's _fucking amazing_. So much catharsis and momentum and we even get a training montage. This novel really holds up.
* Finally, _finally_ finished _Andor_ (2022). And to keep to the theme of the last bullet, yet another slow-mo (with cut scenes of montage) wrap up. Loved how the droids played tag. But then both eldest and the middle one were like, are they sentient? And that's a great question. Is K-2SO sentient? R2-D2? C3PO? I mean, if they are, what in the actual fuck.
* Did not love _Ultimates: Two Years In_. Was sad at how fast Kelly Thompson's _Birds of Prey_ wrapped up. The pacing was just so off.
