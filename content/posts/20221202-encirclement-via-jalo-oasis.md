# AAR:
* **Feb 1942** - Right away, the Allies box Axis in El Agheila, forcing the Germans and Italians to push them out
* **Mar 1942** - A new front is created along the highway  up to Benghazi, but the Axis are still trapped with their backs to the Gulf of Sirte
* **Apr 1942** - New strategy. Axis goes south.
* **May 1942** - Axis masses several units in the Jalo Oasis.
* **Jun 1942** - Nothing happens. Nothing happens. And then boom. Axis rushes out from behind Sabkha El Jeneinen to encircle the Allies in the west! The Allies are routed, OOS, and destroyed.
* **Jul 1942** - Axis screws up and leaves all three of their recon units in the middle of nowhere.
* **Aug 1942** - Allies consolidates around Tobruk. Axis takes Benghazi. Axis hugs the highway next to the Gulf of Sirte
* **Sep 1942** - Allies create a front west of Tobruk. Axis moves a bunch of units to the Jalo Oasis again
* **Oct 1942** - More maneuvering, but no major moves.
* **Nov 1942** - Allies move around Jebel el Akhdar, while Axis creates a long supply chain on the trail from Jalo Oasis to Jarabub Oasis. And then, a sharp turn northeast! Cutting off supply lines again. And in a final move, three Axis units rush to and lay siege to Tobruk.
