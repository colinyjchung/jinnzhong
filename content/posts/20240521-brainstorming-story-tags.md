Been stuck on tagging all of last week and this week. Starting to realize it's not as simple as [DSR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/dsr/) and [PROG](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prog/) tags. PROG has to be broken up into FOUR different tag categories: [QST](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst) (quests), [NTW](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw/) (network), [INQ](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/inq/) (inquiries), and [ARC](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc/) (character arcs).

As you'll soon see, these four tag categories are heavily influenced by OSC's MICE quotient, and MRK's revised version of it... but I'm trying to make it more _functional and useful_ to me and the way my brain processes it, which unfortunately, doesn't give me a memorable acronym like MICE. But let's go through them...

{{< toc >}}

## Quests [QST]

**QST**, or "Quests", are the action beats that drive a story. Unless it's an action film where one action defines the entire story, it is a series of them in a longer work (film/novel), but perhaps only one in a short story. It's akin to EVENT in the MICE quotient, but more clear, specific, and functional to me. It tells me what the PROT has to do. 

Here's what I have so far...

* **[qst: ASK](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-ask/)** - Go ask, beg, negotiate X for Y
* **[qst: BATTLE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-battle/)** - Protect, or defend against attacks, or go somewhere to fight X.
* **[qst: CREATE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-create/)** - Invent, create, perform, or make X
* **[qst: DELIVER](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-deliver/)** - Bring X (character or object) to Y
* **[qst: ESCAPE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-escape/)** - Get out of or away from X, run and hide
* **[qst: FETCH](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-fetch/)** - Go get, find, rescue, steal, claim, buy, or win X
* **[qst: GO SEE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-go-see/)** - Go to X to see, explore, or investigate
* **[qst: HUNT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-hunt/)** - Chase, hunt, pursue, and avenge or kill.

I don't know if this is exhaustive in terms of pure actions, but it feels fairly exhaustive to me. QSTs are straight-up "go do x" tasks. It might run into conflict, obstacles, opposition, constraints, or traps, but it's not "baked in" if that makes sense. I think 90% of everyday tasks in the real world just happen routinely.

However, it should be noted that if the story doesn't make a big deal of it, if it doesn't dramatize it, nor is the action itself load-bearing, and you can handwave it, that is -- skip the parts where you're going from location A to location B, then it is NOT a QST sequence. 

## Network [NTW]

**NTW**, or "Network", is the social network in which the characters live. This is one of my biggest "breakthroughs" on story construction, at least theoretically. It's sorta like milieu in the MICE quotient, but again, I'm re-tagging everything because I found the original OSC definition of it lacking. MRK uses "milieu" to dictate the action as going to a place and getting out, or choosing to stay, or whatever. It's clearly "place". But I reviewed my old [1988 OSC notes](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/notes-characters-and-viewpoint-1988-by-orson-scott-card/#milieu). It states: "in [their] travels [they] reveal the attitude and expectations of the cultural ambience through his eyes."[^1]

So in the 1988 book, _Character and Viewpoint)_, OSC hints at the "cultural ambience". I'm taking this one level deeper to talk about the social fabric and cultural norms which our characters are woven into and how we struggle against it. For me, NTW is about power dynamics, the individual versus the group, how we prey on each other, the hierarchy, the system, loyalty to, or rebelling against the rules. And there are clear PROGs here too. It might have a lot of little QSTs to drive the story forward, but there's a clear arc from A to B. I've also noticed that NTW shows up as the "reason why" at the end of a lot of PURE QST stories. At the end of _Snowpiercer_ (2013) which is a [qst: GO SEE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-go-see/) quest (Get to the front of the train, they don't really know why or how they'll rebel, but they just know they need to get to the front...), and recently for me, _Never Let Me Go_ (2005), which in the third act is a [qst: ASK](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-ask/) quest (go ask Madame about a deferral and the art gallery)... the person in power reveals the NTW the characters never saw.

NTW, for me then, isn't just milieu so much as the power structure, the infrastructure and institutions, and the hierarchy we deal with every day. It could be a close knit group of friends, again, like _Never Let Me Go_ where Kath, Ruth, and Tommy have a love triangle... to all the different predator/prey relationships in _Cloud Atlas_ (2004), to two warring families in _Romeo and Juliet_ (1597)... to epic, galaxy-spanning factions in _Dune_ (1965), or even multiverse-hopping worlds of the MCU. The key for me here are RELATIONSHIPS and the inherent **POWER DYNAMIC** between people in relationships. Even in a marriage, there may be someone who settled, or someone who married above their station, or someone who's put on a pedestal. Someone has power, somebody else is disempowered, exploited, or taken advantaged of. The wider the power dynamic, the greater the social conflict. Here's what I have in order of having power to not, to actively working against it...

* **[ntw: WIELD](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-wield/)** - Maintain, protect, and defend your power
* **[ntw: CLIMB](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-climb/)** - Move up, trade up, and strive for power
* **[ntw: FOLLOW](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-follow/)** - Follow orders/rules, maintain standards, get "pulled back in", even self-sacrifice (inside circle)
* **[ntw: SUFFER](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-suffer/)** - Be exploited, abused, insulted, ostracized, or hazed (outside circle)
* **[ntw: FLEE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-flee/)** - Run away from the more powerful group, leave the system.
* **[ntw: EXPOSE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-expose/)** - Expose, or rat out the system, circle, or group, reporting it to a larger or influential-enough power
* **[ntw: FIGHT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-fight/)** - Straight-up directly go up against the power; argue, threaten, lawsuits, combat, declare war.
* **[ntw: REBEL](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw-rebel/)** - Organize the resistance, fight the system

## Character Arcs [ARC]

The character arc is a little more difficult to suss out. Most websites talk about the ascending, flat, and descending arc... which like The Hero's Journey is simply not _functional and useful_. It's too abstracted to actually use as elements to build a story. What helped me figure this out better is MRK's arc acronym of DREAM (Denial, Reluctance, Exploration, Acceptance, Manifestation). If we start there, then all ARCs are essentially a denial first, and with that... we can actually build scenes and sequences from that starting point (which is _functional and useful_ for constructing a story).

As with the two above tag groups, I'm trying to essentialize "types" as much as I can without losing usefulness. That's important. If it gets too abstracted like, again, The Hero's Journey, to keep beating a dead horse... then it becomes useless. So if we start with say, a table of common denial-acceptance pairs, it might look something like this:

| Denial | Misbehavior |Acceptance |
|:--- |:---:|:---|
| "I don't know anything, but I want X" | Naive Fool |"I have a lot to learn" |
| "I need to prove myself" | Chipped Shoulder | "I am enough." |
| "I can do it myself, I can do it ALL" | Invincible Ego | "I'm human and I need boundaries" |
| "I don't need other people" | Lone Wolf | "I need my found family" |
| "I'm fine. EVERYTHING is FINE!" | Bad Coping | "Everything isn't fine. I need to change" |
| "I'm doing this for X (noble reason)" | Bad Excuse | "Actually, I'm doing this for selfish reasons"|
| "The sacrifice is worth it for the greater good" | Blind Loyalty |"Actually, we're hurting people" |
| "I must be/do/have X, it's who I am!" | Holding On | "I'm not defined by X, and it's OK" |

* **[arc: WISE UP](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-wise-up/)** - the naive, idealistic, romantic who pursues X blindly realizes there are costs, learns and grows up, now "knows better"
* **[arc: GROUNDED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-grounded/)** - the insecure, chip-on-shoulder individual who over-extends, overworks, realizes they are "enough" as they are.
* **[arc: HIT LIMITS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-hit-limits/)** - either through ego or a sense of martyrdom, this person carries the weight of everything on their shoulder... until they break
* **[arc: FIND FAM](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-find-fam/)** - the maverick loner, who doesn't follows rules, does their own thing finds their "family" they can trust, and be a part of a tribe
* **[arc: GET UNSTUCK](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-get-unstuck/)** - someone who has compromised a lot to survive (via coping mechanisms) finds the courage to get unstuck and live freely again
* **[arc: UGLY TRUTH](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-ugly-truth/)** - the power hungry, ambitious, ruthless person who keeps hoarding to "protect their family" or some other noble excuse realizes they're doing it for selfish reasons.
* **[arc: NEW FRAME](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-new-frame/)** - someone with blind loyalty sees the cracks in the system, questions it, eventually changes their mind, gets a new perspective or frame-of-reference
* **[arc: LET GO](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-let-go/)** - someone who is holding on to their identity at the cost of love, family, self-confidence, whatever realizes they need to let go.

## Inquiry [INQ]

OK, so now we're at the only MICE quotient letter I didn't change, since MRK already did from OSC. Originally, it was "Idea", and OSC wrote: "Idea is about a PROBLEM or question posed to main character and audience. The answer is revealed at the end." MRK didn't change the meaning of it, but did label it way more clearer. It's an inquiry. Or put even more clearly, it's a mystery. And the beats of a mystery are always nearly the same:

1. Be presented with a mystery (the what)
2. Gather, find, or stumble on to clues
3. Go to crime scenes (if actual procedural)
4. Interview leads and suspects
5. Figure out network of relationships
6. Narrow down H4W (who, when, where, why, how) until you solve it.

And to be clear - mysteries don't have to be a crime (murder, kidnapping, theft) that you solve. Obviously that's a whole genre in and of itself. But you can _weave_ "inquiry threads" into the fabric of your story, or make it the entire overarching story. As MRK pointed out before, _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813) is a mystery. Who the hell is Darcy and why is he such a jerk? Get clues, get more clues, get proposed to (what?!), get a letter explaining why he hates Wickham... and then more mysterious behavior like helping out Lydia, but also showing up at the wedding. Dude just doesn't conform to the norm.

So here are some inquiry questions I think expands what an INQ is beyond just crime.

* What's their deal?
* Who's fucking with me?
* Who's the traitor/spy?
* What does this do?
* Is this rumor true?
* H4W did it?
