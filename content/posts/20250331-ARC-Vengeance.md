The Vengeance ARC is where PROT is radicalized. They start in a "Bad Place" for their STS. Life is miserable, they're oppressed, they have had almost everything taken from them, and they just need that "final straw that breaks the camel's back" to happen before they have nothing to lose and start a revolution, join a terrorist cell, or start organizing. The ARC then is a story of oppression to vengeance at an organized level. This is opposed to the Fugitive ARC where PROT starts in a "Good Place" and sees the system for what it is. People who are treated well inside a system rarely become radicalized enough to rebel against it, but people who are oppressed will.

This is a story about the underdog, but as a group working together. You could potentially argue that heist stories sort of fall under this category. The ARC is PROT loses something they love, the last straw, and then slowly becomes more and more radicalized until they break free and defy gravity.

The Vengeance ARC is a NEGATIVE or POSITIVE one depending on which side you're on. Are they revolutionaries or terrorists? Which one is the Rebel Alliance? What about District 13? What about Dumbledore's Army? After all, schools are where students get radicalized, right?

## The Emotional Arc

* **STS**: _My life sucks! I hate it, but I'm going to keep my head down and stay out of trouble._
* **DSR**: [last straw] _oh FUCK YOU. You took away the ONE thing I had in this world._
* **BWO**: _I am SO angry. I'm plotting revenge. How can I hurt you?_
* **PNR**: _I'm following thru with my plans even though others told me it's too dangerous._
* **AIL**: _Oh fuck, what have I done? Was it worth it? Look at the dead bodies._
* **CMX**: _Yes, yes it was. I'm going to take down the system/the man even if it kills me._

_alt. CMX_: PROT crushed by the System/Man/Empire, but dies a martyr.

## The Stakes

* Losing the "last thing" - honor, respect, way of life
* Having everything taken away with nothing to lose, just wants to hurt the system now
* Having what they value the most threatened, so goes on the attack

## The Triangle(s)

* PROT: The Reluctant Hero
* The "Final Straw" - a lover, ally, or someone important taken away
* Other Revolutionaries - the team they build
* ANTG: The Oppressive System, the Man, Horrible Bosses, The Evil Empire
