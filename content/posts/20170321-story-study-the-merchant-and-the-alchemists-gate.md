The metal hoop is something that can transport you to twenty years in the future. Bashaarat does two tricks to prove to him it’s not an illusion. Bashaarat assures him that it’s not magic. But this is just a prelude to what he wants to show Fuwaad. He takes him to another room and shows him an entire human sized gate. He tells him that he could step through to the future. And many customers have done it. But Fuwaad says, didn’t you just say that you haven’t showed anyone this magical thing yet? And Bashaarat says, well. This one.

And then one day after selling tons of rope, and with a full purse, he gets it stolen by a boy, and he chases him and catches him but lets him go after getting his purse back. He goes back to older Hassan and asked him why he didn’t let him know about it? Older Hassan is like, wasn’t that a good experience you enjoyed?
