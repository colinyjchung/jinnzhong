## Disruptions (DSR)

DSRs are inciting incidents or the "set up". But I like "disruption" better, because it reminds you that there is a STASIS (STS) to disrupt first. PROTs aren't doing nothing before they get disrupted. They have a life along with a backstory of why they've chosen this life. A DSR forces them to re-think this life.

## Progress (PROG)

PROG is the middle of a story. It encompasses BWO (B-World), MID (Midpoint), LOW (Lowpoint), CMX (Climax). They are the beats of a story: actions, events, moves. There is a linear progression from point A to point B. Along the way are obstacles and conflict.
