The Fugitive ARC is where the PROT lives inside a system, and may even be the paragon of said system, but then sees "something" that makes them question their faith and sends them on a journey of doubt. That "something" is usually PROT witnessing a rule being broken (tacit or explicit rule). In a muted drama, it could be a priest, rookie, or anyone really at an institution that bought in completely -- maybe from a young age, someone with aspirations. In a thriller, it's someone caught in a "wrong place, wrong time" situation and sees a hint of how corrupt the system is. PROT is usually someone who just wants to stay "head down", follow the rules, and get the reward promised to them by the system.

After the illusion is broken, in a thriller, the PROT will "follow the money", see "how high it goes", uncover the "web of lies", and think "everyone's out to get them". In a drama, PROT might have difficult and uncomfortable conversations with their closest and loved ones, might stray from the system, but contrasted with the Justice ARC, they ultimately go back to the system. The system is not perfect, what triggered the doubt was a system outlier/aberration/criminal. The status quo doesn't change. Or PROT learns to live with the flaws of the system.

The Fugitive ARC is a POSITIVE ARC when the story is about a restoration of faith, provided the system reflects society's values. If PROT sees the system as corrupt (again, provided it reflects what the audience believes is wrong in society) and walks away, it is still a POSITIVE ARC.

## The Emotional Arc

* **STS**: _My life is great! I have everything I've ever wanted, I got goals, a way up._
* **DSR**: [rule broken] _Wait. That's not supposed to happen. Stop it. I don't want it._
* **BWO**: _OMG. What the fuck is this? Why haven't I noticed this before? This is WRONG._
* **PNR**: _Fuck, I need to figure this out even tho everyone's telling me to stop. To go back._
* **AIL**: _I shouldn't have come here. I've lost everything. I should've turned back. Ignorance was bliss._
* **CMX**: _No, actually. I'm right for choosing this path even tho people got hurt. This was the RIGHT THING to do_

_alt. CMX_: PROT walks away, commits suicide (literally or figuratively), or sacrifices their entire life.

## The Stakes

* Realizing your entire world was built on lies
* Realizing your entire world was "pure and good", ordered, and perfect.
* Dread of changing all your anchors: your relationships, home, way you live.

## The Triangle(s)

* PROT: The Shaken Faithful
* Other Faithfuls (your anchors who tell you to stop questioning. Go back.)
* The "Other Side" that shook you out of your illusion.
* ANTG: A character who represents the antithesis of this system, or a "virus" who exploits the system's weakness.
