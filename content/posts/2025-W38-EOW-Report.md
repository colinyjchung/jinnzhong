## Anti-Goal Cycling

* Garage Fiction Podcast read [prj:SAVED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-saved/) this week. They were suitably complimentary, but it was pointed out there were typos. I put off looking said typos until late in the week. This past week was really looking closer at [RLTS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/rlts-part-two/), my newest abbreviation. It stands for Relationships. More notably, my favorite quote from Kieron Gillen that _"I don't have favorite characters, I have favorite relationships"_ and went down a bit of a dissection, analysis, and taxonomization of relationship pairs. My hypothesis as you can read in the linked article is that by studying and creating these RLTS templates, or catalyst points (because I hate "jumping off points"), it would serve me a lot better than trying to attach an ARC. ARCs are great, but they don't seem to generate story. They generate navel gazing emotionality -- which again, is great and I love that and I want them in my stories -- but by themselves, they don't help with the PROG. A RLTS creates or helps start a PROG.
* That said, I also worked on and created a prototype of an Excel Submission Tracker based on the ones I found inside MRK's Discord ([CG](https://christinadgoodman.com) & [DW](https://deirdrewalker.carrd.co)). Ready to get on the rejection train.

* Rough Week: Part One. Something I knew was going to happen but not when finally did happen. Ended up not sleeping well early parts of the week. I got the news a day earlier than everyone else. They were blindsided by how fast things moved once it started moving, it was matter-of-fact to me. It was ugly but necessary. The premonition of a revolution every quarter seems to have stayed on rhythm.
* Rough Week: Part Two. Went on a ninety minute walk around Burrard Inlet, went as far as Old Orchard Park, my feet were sore from the Blundstones chafing against my heels. I hope what they're saying in confidence to me is true. I can only listen at this point and hope and have faith. There isn't much else I can do but be present and around and listen.
* Rough Week: Part Three. Two A.M. Truths that while not surprising, was also not good, but not devastating. What can I do but be present? I feel like that's all that's asked of me these days and I'm told it's sufficient, and that's weird to me as I've always been The Action-Taker.


## Story Introspection

* Getting near the CMX of _Call Me By Your Name_ (2007) by Andr√© Aciman. Everything's about to blow up I think.
* Only three comics in my pull list this week and I didn't even read one of them. The gradual sunsetting is very real. Four miniseries will end in October. I did, however, fell for Leah Williams again. The ashcan for Voyeur was very good. In very, very, very sad news, it was announced in the December DC Solicits that Kelly Thompson will be ending her run on Birds of Prey. I was really hoping it would go on. This run was the very first run I've collected from beginning to end and loved every single issue. I imagine there are not a lot of those in a comic reader's life. I would imagine most overstay their welcome or get cancelled too early or the creative team changes on them. I guess I can only hope Absolute Wonder Woman goes on until issue 50 or more. She did say on her blog, however, she has another DC project she needs to pitch but haven't yet... and also, she's writing Buffy and Angel. So I will wait for Ms. Thompson to cook.
* I have named the ten stories I've studied over and over again "The Decemviri". Although, as I think about it, it's not particularly well thought out.
