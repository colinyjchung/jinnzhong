**Based on**: _The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas_ by Ursula K. Le Guin - [source](https://files.libcom.org/files/ursula-k-le-guin-the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas.pdf)

1. No POV, a distant/disembodied narrator describing a festival/ritual/process MECH
2. It's not XYZ (All the expectations you might have about a MECH like this)
3. The MECH is about to begin. Fanfare, music, signals.
4. The REVEAL: all this is paid for by X (wherein X is a shocking, disgusting, grotesque cost)
5. The rules/culture surrounding X (how everyone is aware of it and how they react to it. How they justify, accept, and reframe it to live with it.
6. But some refuse to pay the cost and leave.
