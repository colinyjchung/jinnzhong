Been stuck on tagging all of last week and this week. Starting to realize it's not as simple as [DSR](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/dsr/) and [PROG](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prog/) tags. PROG has to be broken up into three different tag categories: [QST](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst)/, [NTW](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/ntw/), and [ARC](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc/).

Quickly...

## QST

**QST**, or "Quests", are the action beats that define a story. Unless it's an action film where one action defines the entire story, it is a series of them. It's akin to EVENT on in the MICE quotient, but more clear, specific, and functional to me. It tells me what the PROT has to do. Here's what I have so far...
* [qst: ASK](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-ask/) - Go ask, beg, negotiate X for Y
* [qst: CREATE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-create/) - Invent, create, perform, or make X
* [qst: DELIVER](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-deliver/) - Bring X (character or object) to Y
* [qst: ESCAPE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-escape/) - Get out of or away from X
* [qst: FETCH](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-fetch/) - Go get, steal, buy, or win something
* [qst: HUNT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-hunt/) - Chase, hunt, pursue and avenge or kill.
* [qst: RESCUE](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-rescue/) - Go rescue someone
* [qst: VISIT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-visit/) - Go to X to see, explore, or investigate

## NTW

**NTW**, or "Network", is the social network in which the characters live. This is one of my biggest "breakthroughs" on story construction, at least theoretically. It's sorta like milieu in the MICE quotient, but again, I'm re-tagging everything because I found the original OSC definition of it lacking. MRK uses "milieu" to dictate the action as going to a place and getting out, or choosing to stay, or whatever. It's clearly "place". But I reviewed my old [1988 OSC notes](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/notes-characters-and-viewpoint-1988-by-orson-scott-card/#milieu). It states: "in [their] travels [they] reveal the attitude and expectations of the cultural ambience through his eyes."

So in the 1988 book, _Character and Viewpoint)_, OSC hints at the "cultural ambience". I'm taking this one level deeper to talk about the social fabric and cultural norms which our characters are woven into and how we struggle against it. For me, NTW is about power dynamics, the individual versus the group, how we prey on each other, the hierarchy, the system, loyalty to or rebelling against the rules. And there are clear PROGs here too. It might have a lot of little QSTs to drive the story forward, but there's a clear arc from A to B. I've also noticed that NTW shows up as the "reason why" at the end of a lot of PURE QST stories. At the end of _Snowpiercer_ (2013) which is a [qst: VISIT](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-visit/) quest (Get to the front of the train), and recently _Never Let Me Go_ (2005), which in the third act is a [qst: ASK](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/qst-ask/) quest (go ask Madame about a deferral)... the person in power reveals the NTW the characters never saw.
