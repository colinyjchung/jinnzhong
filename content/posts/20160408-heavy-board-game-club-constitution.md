## PREMISE
HBC works on the premise that when most people have board game nights, they invite everyone... and then six or more people of varying degrees of interest show up... which leads to you playing only casual party games like Codenames, Resistance, Deception or whatever.

Nothing wrong with that, but... this means heavy board games (weighted 3 or higher) rarely (if ever) get on the table.

So - instead of inviting everyone, HBC does this instead:

One person proposes a game, place and time to the Discord server. Then, on a first come, first serve basis -- members commit to the slots available. (Ideally, they watch a walkthrough or read the rules beforehand as well.)

This system has allowed us to get games as extreme as Through the Ages, Dominant Species and Indonesia on the table.

## THE RULES

### 1. THE FIRST RULE:

The first rule of Heavy Club is you don't talk about Heavy Club.

(Just kidding! If you have a friend who likes doing "competitive project management and accounting" after a long day of work... let us know! We can add them to our secret Discord server.)

### 2. HOW TO PROPOSE A GAME:

To propose a game, please edit the google sheet at [LINK]

### 3. HOW TO JOIN A GAME
* Simply put your name down on the google sheets, it is a first come, first serve.
* Please note this is a commitment. Due to busy adult lives, it's not cool to cancel, not show up, or request game changes at the last minute. Oftentimes, these games are 3-4 players, and if one person cancels last minute, it puts the entire table at risk of not happening.
* Also, because we want players to come prepared (having familiarized themselves with the rules), please do not request sudden game changes. We are playing heavy games here. Rules are hard to learn.
* Please also note there are no "maybes": You are either committed to the proposed game, time and place... or you're not. It's that simple. We cannot plan around people who aren't sure.

**IMPORTANT:** We have kicked flakes out of this group before. Don't be a flake.

### 4. THE FIRST & THIRD FRIDAY

We have regular ongoing nights. It's the first and third Friday of every month. We'll alternate between Coquitlam & Vancouver, depending on which host is available to host. But just because those exist doesn't mean you can't propose other impromptu nights/games. We encourage other nights to be proposed.
