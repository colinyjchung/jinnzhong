My Chinese name is 鐘藝進. The Mandarin pinyin is zhōng yì jìn. Breaking down each ideogram...

* 鐘 (zhōng) is the surname.
* 藝 (yì) combined with another ideogram (藝術) means "the arts".
* 進 (jìn) is "to advance, to move forward".

When I was younger, I used to joke my name meant "to advance the arts". But according to my father:

> 藝 (yì) in Chinese is not only Art it can be combined with other words to become a different meaning. We both thought out the name for you. Your Mom wanted her son had the same dream as her to become an artist but in reality, the path to become an artist and make a comfortable life is not easy. That's why we came up with 進 which means improvement or thrive and develop to be a better person not only succeed in getting a better career but also to be a helpful and friendly person. To conclude 藝進 is improving. 藝 can also be 技藝 is technology or skills.

The spelling of yì jìn on my Canadian birth certificate is spelt Yuet Jinn however. I once asked my father why he spelled it so weird. For one thing, we spoke Cantonese at home, and the pronunciation he chose for my name are the Mandarin ones. Secondly, yì converted to Yuet just makes no sense. And why does jìn have an extra "n"? He had no answer for me.

That said, Jinn with an extra "n" is just _too good_ to not use as my literary pseudonym. It means I can grant wishes, after all. What's more -- the "zh" in zhōng sounds very close to the English "j" sound, so I get the benefit of alliteration in "Jinn Zhong".
