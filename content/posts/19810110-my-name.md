My Chinese name is 鐘藝進. The pinyin is zhōng yì jìn. Breaking down each ideogram...

* 鐘 (zhōng) is a simply a surname, but it may mean "to concentrate one's love or attention".
* 藝 (yì) combined with another ideogram (藝術) means "the arts". My mother chose this.
* 進 (jìn) is "to advance, to move forward". My father chose this.

In a way, you could argue my name means "to advance the arts", but you don't need to feed my bottomless ego, really.

On my Canadian birth certificate, the latter two ideograms are spelt "yuet jinn". I once asked my father why he spelled it so weird. It's weird for two reasons. One, he speaks Cantonese, and the pronunciation he chose for my name are the Mandarin ones. Two, why is yì spelt "yuet"? _What?!_ Why does jìn have an extra "n"? He had no answer aside from the fact English was his third language and he'd only been in the country for three years at that point.

That said, Jinn with an extra "n" is just _too good_ to not use as my literary pseudonym. It means I can grant wishes, after all. What's more -- the "zh" in zhōng sounds very close to the English "j" sound, so I get the benefit of alliteration in "Jinn Zhong".
