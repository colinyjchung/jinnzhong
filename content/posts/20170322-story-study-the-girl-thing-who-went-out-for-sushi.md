## SCENE ONE (809)
Fry, the two-stepper, bipedal human breaks her leg while working. They work on the orbit of Jupiter. There’s mention of the Okeke-Hightower asteroid/comet about to hit Jupiter. Everyone is obsessed with it. Fry decides to “go out for sushi” which is to say she’s going to transform into some marine animal life form like the rest of her crew. BACKSTORY: It doesn’t make sense to Arkae (the narrator), because Fry was a genius and a beauty queen. Because of that she’s filthy rich, but why is she doing mining work out on the Jupiter orbit? She saved up all her endorsements, scholarship and appearance money to… go to geology school?

## SCENE TWO (514)
MORE BACKSTORY/WORLD BUILDING: Fry is an oddity. There are mixed-crews in JovOp, but Arkae likes Fry right away. Sushi were made for space work apparently, but two-steppers are not. There is a tiered society here. Medical jobs are for bipedal only. That’s law. Arkae doesn’t have real numbers but she thinks six every eight weeks (or decs, which is 10 day weeks). People were converted due to terminal illness or crime. Every Jove year is about 12 Dirt years. Sushi also don’t think in binary like bipeds do.

## SCENE THREE (1054)
Arkae goes see Fry in a clinic. Her entire wing is closed off unless you’re on “The List”. Fry’s real name is La Soledad y Godmundsdottir. They’re in micro-gravity and the person who escorts Arkae to see Fry has to use two poles with sticky ends to move around. Fry is in a huge bed. They talk. Fry didn’t know about the List. Fry asks about work. Fry gets mad at nurses, Arkae tells her to be cool. Arkae knows her surgery itches like hell. Fry is still famous and rich and now Dirt wants him her back on Earth. Fry asks Arkae if she knows any lawyers out here. They’re all sushi.

## SCENE FOUR (445)
BACKSTORY: There are “chambered Nautilus” and they do knowledge work. Lawyers, librarians, researchers. Dove is a civil law and sushi rights lawyer. More WORLD BUILDING: sushi-in-transition, pre-ops, etc.

## SCENE FIVE (856)
Arkae take Dove to see Fry. List Checker is annoyed and prejudiced against Dove. Dove apparently knows Florian (the pole walker). They were taken hostage once before Dove transitioned. Fry is apparently freaked out by Nautilus Dove’s wormy things. But not Arkae’s suckers… They talk about the work involved. Loands and money. Fry asks if she can talk to her new lawyer alone. Arkae is offended. 

## SCENE SIX (1115)
Arkae has work (to weed and reseed the halo). They send a Fry a cheer up video. Fry talks about her job. MORE BACKSTORY/WORLD BUILDING. Apparently some crew didn’t finish their job earlier. There are AIs like tube-worm  and jellies. I think Jellie is what they travel in? MORE WORLD BUILDING - Octo-Semaphore is a way to talk where everyone uses a different language and the language changes from one conversation to the next. I guess all Octopuses are multi-lingual?? They try to figure out what the dead sensors are for. They think somebody is trying to get a better view of the Okeke-Hightower hit. They take it all out (takes 2 J days), then they reseed with proper sensors. Arkae calls Fry, she gets Dove instead. She’s in surgery.

## SCENE SEVEN (533)
Dove is not allowed to tell people what form Fry has chosen. They get a drone. (messages usually from JovOp). They’re confused.  They argue about reporting it. The Jellie makes a snarky comment. Dubonnet says he’s easy to go home and log out.

## SCENE EIGHT (280)
WORLDBUILD on private quarters. Arkae remembers Fry being a slob and stuff of hers would float around in the micro-gravity. And now she misses her.

## SCENE NINE (743)
The crew makes bets on which form Fry has chosen. Message from Dove comes. Not much about Fry. Arkae contemplates on the fact that she didn’t have much choice on what form when she got transformed. But she’s ok with it now. But now the video is showing two-steppers being all judgemental about them. Glynnis sheds a positive light on the situation. They get to see the Okeke-Hightower comet. They won’t. And they’ll go extinct.

## SCENE TEN (480)
Arkae tells Dove they’ll be down under for two J-days. MORE WORLDBUILDING - Inner vs. Outer planets. Deals with JovOP vs Saturn.

## SCENE ELEVEN (252)
Arkae thinks about what Fry will be like as Sushi. 

## SCENE TWELVE (1515)
They head home in a JovOp Can. Some people think the Okeke-Hightower asteroid is actually a communication from alien life form and we should catch it to see if there’ stuff on there. JovOp maybe doing that. Rumours say. The crew watches the comet fall. Halfway through the impacts, the government overrides all communication. And there get no news or replays or anything. Then they get a video from Fry. She has become a chambered Nautilus.  She thanks them for their time and friendship. She’s going on a potential dangerous colonization mission the Jupiter Colony. A cloud-borne colony.

## SCENE THIRTEEN (426)
The crew get taken in for questioning. Apparently there were dirt spies amongst them. The ruling council resign. The acting council are all sushi. That’s a first. The elections coming up show that there are more sushi candidates. But most of them are chambered Nautiluses. So even within this transformed race, there are tiers and levels.
