**Based on**: _Ten Deals with the Indigo Snake_ by Mel Kassel - [source](http://lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/ten-deals-with-the-indigo-snake/)

1. POV uses a MECH (transaction/exchange) that this world knows is inherently dangerous/risky/comes-with-unknown monkey's paw risks. First time, cost is trivial. Second time is costly.
2. POV refuses to use MECH for a while, but needs a thing and gets sucked back in.
3. They use the MECH for something unforgivable (love, murder, control, fame, etc.)
4. The unforgivable use of MECH has tons of consequences: Some self-inflicted, some due to debt collectors, some revenge. POV uses MECH to escape and just digs a deeper hole.
5. Consequences threaten someone affected by "3" - they're pulled back into POV's life. They don't want to be and ask them to reverse MECH. It's the lowest of the low.
6. POV goes away without MECH to fix their own problems naked.
