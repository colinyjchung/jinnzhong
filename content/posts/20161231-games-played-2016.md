[^1]: First game with randos on BGA. Played a couple of Twilight Struggle with randos on Chantry too before Arry was forced to shut it down.
[^2]: I thought I played more games against kale and finalresistance, but I guess I'm wrong.
[^3]: Gamers on the Internet are hard.
[^4]: This was a "just one more" nightcap I recall
[^5]: They all tried coming for the king. Rare game of brilliance.
[^6]: The inaugural game of the [Heavy Board Game Club](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/heavy-board-game-club-constitution/)
[^7]: The moment I completely, utterly fell in love with heavily weighted games and swore off all simple party games (mostly).
[^8]: My first brush with Vital Lacerda. So many things to keep track of, yet so enjoyable.
[^9]: First Splotter Spellen game. Also the seed of my own destruction for all Euros. This is the point where I can pinpoint I start to get sick of "simultaneous solitaire worker placement" games... and crave interactive head-on zero-sum conflict. Although arguably, Twilight Struggle could be a proto-seed.
[^10]: Applied the precept that military buildup is for the purpose of intimidation (making the other side second guess attacking) as opposed to actually using your army.
[^11]: Just realized this as I'm putting this together... Started the year playing  Twilight Struggle in my Riverwalk Basement with my brother, ended the year playing Vinhos on Christmas with my brother.
[^12]: Gen Con
[^13]: It was one of these three games where I literally had to get out of the house and walk to get my heart rate down. I was the Allies and I had one die roll that could've broken thru the Western Front in 2014 and end the war.
[^14]: The Twilight Struggle addiction begins here. See my [write-up here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/i-finally-get-twilight-struggle-2005/)
[^15]: Paths of Glory becomes a huge fascination for 2016 too. see my [write-up here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/paths-of-glory-1999-is-grueling-mentally-exhausting-and-draining/)
