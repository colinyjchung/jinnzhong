**Based on**: _A Temporary Matter_ by Jhumpa Lahiri - source: _Interpreter of Maladies_ (1999).

1. A unique situation forces 2+ characters who used to be close, but have since grown distant to spend time together over several "repeatable events". Add lots of backstory of why they "broke up".
2. The first event is awkward, so one person suggests a "game" for future "repeatable events" until it's over. Game ideas: reveal secret, truth or dare, gamble, stories, bring up memories. This is the MECH.
3. The game brings them closer again (remembering the good times) over the course of the successive events. If former lovers, they may even make love.
4. The "repeateable event" ends its cycle, but they play the game one last time. And at this "final game", everyone reveals a dark secret or truth that separates them again. But this time in a sad, irrevocable way.
