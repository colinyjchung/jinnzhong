Something Olivia shared on one of our post-GFP recordings i/r/t the Kindle market, which is our 21st century version of mass market fiction feeding an insatiable beast... is that (this opinion is mine) these kinds of stories are basically self-help.

The thought process and insight is Olivia's, the reading is mine, to be clear. And the insight is that this audience wants an inspiring stand-in PROT that has gone through the same disastered _they have_, but they're more resilient, more resourceful, and more proactive about it. Plus, they're experiencing a magical means of solving their problems as well. Put another way, they are inspiring stand-ins. Character that the audience can look up to as role-models. And to a degree, almost, if not outright wish-fulfillment.

If you look at the majority of 90s fantasy that was aimed at prepubescent and/or teenage boys like me, the PROT was a stand-in for me. And LitRPG is the modern equivalent of that. And when Olivia describes the 40-something Paranormal crowd... the BtVS/Charmed/Supernatural girls who are now women and going through midlife, divorce, and/or pre-empty-nest... they are using those PROTs as heroes.
