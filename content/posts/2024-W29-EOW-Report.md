## Highlights This Week

* Dragonlance. I picked up Dragonlance again yesterday. Last time I read these, I was eleven or twelve.
* It's been a draining and exhausting week at work. Deep into day-to-day operations of script production now.
* Read and [took notes](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/the-five-arcs/) on _Creating Character Arcs_ (2016) a second time.

I falling more into the day-to-day whirlwind at my job and I reviewed a _lot_ of copy this week. Some of it had to be completely rewritten, which means more training/coaching is required. Someone unexpectedly quit. But more importantly, I have not had as much time to WRITE FICTION. Now granted, this whole of last week, I've been burning through _Creating Character Arcs_ a [second time]((https://journal.jinnzhong.com/the-five-arcs/), but still. I need to wrestle time away for lunch and breaks. I came home extremely exhausted Mon-Wed, like zero energy. With that said. My motivation is increasing. I really feel like character arcs was the missing tool this entire time. Or correction, the _last_ tool.

## Book Reading

* Finished re-reading K.M. Weiland's _Creating Character Arcs_ (2016). More [notes](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/the-five-arcs/). Working on one final pass under the heading "Building Story Kernels"
* Since I started getting back into Marvel comics, I have also decided to regress back to my eleven or twelve year old self and started _Time of The Twins_ (1986), the first in the Dragonlance Legends trilogy. It's interesting what I'm picking up as a 43yo vs. as a 12yo (I mean, obviously), but also what I'm picking up as an aspiring author. I mean, fuck. The novel starts off with Tika covering for Caramon's alcholicism. That's pretty heavy. Considering what I experienced [earlier this year](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/2024-w08-eow-report/). Tanis returns home _still_ carrying the weight of the world, if not more, now that he's a legendary hero. Everyone's an adult now and has kids. I wonder... I wonder if Weis and Hickman played and wrote the first campaign as early 20-smths, then had kids, and then wrote this trilogy. Let's go down a quick rabbit hole, shall we? FIVE MINUTES LATER: And I'm back. So nope. She married, had two kids, straight after college and after a decade, divorced, and ran off to Lake Geneva in 1983 to work for TSR. THREE MINUTES LATER: Hickman was a LDS missionary (why are there so many Mormon fantasy writers???), was 30k in debt and sold some modules to TSR to "literally buy shoes for his kids", and moves to Wisconsin, then creates the Dragonlance setting. Well, that was a fun rabbit hole.
* I never really go into the "cosmic" side of Marvel. Not the comics anyway. But I really enjoyed the first issue of Stephanie Phillips' _Phoenix_ (2024). Of course, the wry, sardonic me is like... _oh OK, so it's like a white savior who goes around the ~~planet~~ galaxy saving ~~third world countries and brown people~~ underdeveloped alien civilizations who can't defend themselves_. And I would imagine Silver Surfer and Captain Marvel also have those overtones? I dunno. I'm... not... offended, but also, I can see how this can be problematic. What worked for me (as it seems to be what I'm zeroing in on -- as I've started to put more attention to [tracking this stuff](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/categories/live-commentary/)) are the _emotional interior_ and _grounded relationship dynamics_ in a story. Pages 15-17, when Jean is meditating in space, making a psychic _long distance call_ to Scott while he's making coffee. That quick conversation, that long-distance marriage... that's the kind of stuff that gets me. Sure, Phoenix can yank an entire prison station out of a black hole and shit... but who cares, right? It's the strained marriage that matters.
* _Atonement_ (2001) continues to bug me to pick it up. I love you literary novel, but I need superheroes and fantasy legends right now. But also, read the first few pages of _Emma_ (1815), which I also love, but yeah. I just want to read trashy fantasy and comics and inhale my nostalgia right now.
