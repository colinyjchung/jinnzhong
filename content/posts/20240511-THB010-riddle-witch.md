**Based on**: _Riddle_ by Ogbewe Amadin - [source](https://firesidefiction.com/riddle)

1. POV is told rumours about a character
2. POV remembers witnessing character being maligned/persecuted by others, accused of X
3. POV spies on character. They _are_ X, actually, but also Y (a reframe of what an X can be)
