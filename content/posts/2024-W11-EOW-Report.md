## Highlights This Week

* Wednesday. Was let go by a client that was worth 2/3rds of my income. That threw everything for a loop. What was crazy was that it was happening in the middle of my three part email series shutting down my newsletter, Osmosis. (Parts [1](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/blame-the-malaysian-end-of-osmosis-p1/3/),  [2](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/how-i-screwed-up-end-of-osmosis-p2/3/), [3](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish-end-of-osmosis-p3/3/)) See below under Four Thousand Weeks for more reflective naval gazing on the situation. Regardless, my daily streak of writing ficiton was broken and things are in chaos now.
* Spent Saturday afternoon [breaking down five flash fiction stories](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/flash-fiction-dissection-for-thbs-1/) to create thumbnail structures I can steal.
* I think losing 2/3rds of my income and blowing up Osmosis is more than enough for one week's of updates, wouldn't you say? I don't need a third point? Oh, two important people in my life turned 40 this week, someone else is pregnant, and my middle one performed Wasia Project's _Petals on the Moon_ and Coldplay's _Viva La Vida_ in a middle school talent show.

Was happily drafting more [prj: BECKY](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-becky/) this week, but also broke down Kij Johnson's Ponies as a THB, which led to [prj: SAVED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-saved/), as MRK had asked us to prepare a short story to write during MMW that's three scenes and complete. And then Wednesday happened. Did not write Thursday/Friday/Saturday. Broke my habitica streak. Wished Habitica kept a record of my longest streaks somewhere. Whatever.

## EOW Time Tracking

If I had to count the number of lengthy retainers I've lost over the years: (K, E, N, S, I, M, C, B, T, P). Ten. That's ten over the last fifteen years as a freelancer. Many of these were just under one year. B and P were the outliers of the last few years. And every time one of these end, it feels like a huge reset. But why? OK, OK, with the most recent one, that was three intense years, I'll give it that. It led to constant anxiety, intense sharp uptake of blood pressure at every communication, and a lot of awkward meetings. I was yelled at, I yelled back. None of it was healthy. It was a toxic environment. And from Wednesday onwards -- I've felt a huge sense of relief, like a large weight lifted off my back. The panic hasn't settled in yet that two-thirds of my income is gone. Wife is obviously upset. I didn't give the proper proactive reassurance I should've. Instead I turtled and needed to go through the emotions myself. On Thursday, when I made my last check-in at my parents' house (while they were in Taiwan/Vietnam), I circled my childhood home. Just re-explored the backyard -- where F and I played street hockey, where barbeques happened, where we ran and play. And then on the way home, I make a last minute decision to visit my first house, the Port Moody townhouse. Walked down the steep hill to where the green behind the complex was. Just stood there for three deep breaths. When I got back to the office, AM was there and we had a good talk about everything happening in her life and mine. Everything feels so chaotic again. Which I suppose is the ingredient for a reset. Perhaps a necessary one. I shared my situation with the MRK SSC and MRK shared a couple of resources. The night before, I went to Starbucks alone, to yes, [dissect flash fiction for thumbnail sketches](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/flash-fiction-dissection-for-thbs-1/), but also to think. To think about my future. What I want to do with my life. I know I don't really want to do what I've been doing the last fifteen years anymore, but I don't know how to move away with that and make the same amount of money I currently (well, used to) make. The industry I picked fifteen years ago is just so... I think it's dying too. It's not going to survive I think. Conversations with JN/KD. But how can I scale? A lot of my income in past years, how it got buffed up was through royalties. And if that's dying or running out... what next? Osmosis didn't work out and I [blew](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/blame-the-malaysian-end-of-osmosis-p1/3/) [it](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/how-i-screwed-up-end-of-osmosis-p2/3/) [up](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/thanks-for-all-the-fish-end-of-osmosis-p3/3/). Is there something I can do there? C-Chord is on spring break for two weeks. (Found out from American colleagues that they only get one week as opposed to my socialist country). So it's going to be a little loosey goosey with a lot of free time minus my one remaining client while I hit up a lot of prospects and get think through things more. This really ruined my 2024 plans to hunker down with just those two clients so I can reallocate all my spare non-work energy to launching fiction. This really feels like the universe is working against me because I decided I _would_ make this change this year to focus. "You want to focus?" the Universe said. "Here, let me throw as many wrenches into your plan as possible. Screw you."

## Book Reading

* Finished _Stranger in a Strange Land_. Live commentary [here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/commentary-stranger-in-a-strange-land-1961/). Was a very disappointing, dated read. Finished _The Hero of Ages_. live commentary [here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/commentary-the-hero-of-ages-2008/). Was OK. Really slow beginning and flat 50-80% middle.
* Didn't push much more on _Timeline_ by Michael Crichton. Didn't touch _Pride and Prejudice_ again for another week. Maybe I should stop seeing it as "vegetables" just because it's a classic.
* Borrowed _The End of the World Is Just Beginning_ while out for a neighborhood walk on Saturday night. Still have _The Accidental Superpower_ (2016) in book form inside my closet, but Libby/Audiobooks gets me through a lot more stuff more efficiently. So far, 5% in, not sharing anything I haven't heard from Zeihan already.

[^1]: LEGEND for **Project Status Dashboard**

    * **prj** = project codename
    * **st** = start date
    * **dr** = 1st draft completed
    * **ed** = edits (before beta/crits) completed
    * **rv** = revisions (post-feedback) completed
    * **fn** = story (or chapter) finished

[^2]: The most important objective of the **EOW Time Tracking** is to ensure that productive hours _are_ dedicated to actual fiction writing. This is to prevent excuses, distractions, and procrastination activities like... Using "I'm too busy with client work" as an excuse or doing unnecessary "fiction-related" activities (like consuming more craft education, excessive world-building research, and working on marketing stuff when I'm not even published yet!)
