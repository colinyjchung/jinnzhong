I stared into the abyss of existential dread again today. I told XX that this would be my last project for them and I meant it. I told my business partners. I told my wife. AA encouraged it because I looked so ragged. I told YY and this past weekend, when projections predicted they would lose money, it threw everything into uncertainty again. This recession will last 12-18 months and I don't know how to escape anymore. I'm exhausted and can't have projects like these hanging over my head anymore.

I thought about what I really wanted and it still goes back to fiction.
