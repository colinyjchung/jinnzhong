**Based on**: _The Court Magician_ by Sarah Pinsker- [source](https://lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-court-magician/)

1. A dispossessed POV is spying on a POI who is naturally talented and hungry at getting good at X. POV sends an invitation to POI to go deeper down the rabbit hole.
2. The rabbit hole is challenging, but not unsolvable for the POI. (This was a test from the POV).  POI complains and wants the "real thing". A deal with the devil is made. High reward plus uncertain/vague T&C. POI agrees.
3. The POI uses power for the first time. The cost is revealed. It's shocking but they justify it in their heads. But unexpected side effects/consequences are also paid.
4. Time passes, costs pile up, POI understands why side effects happens. POI tries to hack system, can't, and uses power one last time, then walks away.
