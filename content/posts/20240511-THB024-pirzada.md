**Based on**: _When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine_ by Jhumpa Lahiri - source: _Interpreter of Maldies_ (1999).

1. POV (young, inexperienced, or rookie) receives a visitor within the POV's group. The visitor can't go home because of reasons (politics, war, situation at home).
2. POV is affected because they relate to or are curious by the visitor's plight. There is a thread of connection.
3. Visitor does their best to be a great guest -- curious about the POV group's customs, offers to help, worries about POV with kindness. POV, in turn, takes time to learn more about visitor.
4. POV experiences a "trivial" sadness in their life, but realizes it's nothing compared to what the vistor is going through when the visitor's situation at home gets worse.
5. Visitor goes home. Much later, writes to let POV knows they're OK.
