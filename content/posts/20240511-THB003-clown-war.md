**Based on**: _War of the Clowns_ by Mia Couto - [source](https://www.massreview.org/sites/default/files/Couto,%20Mia.pdf)

1. A seemingly harmless but interesting spectacle is happening. The audience watches in amusement. THe spectacle increases in danger.
2. As the danger increases, collateral damage happens. Some of the audience begins to wonder if they should be worried. They are told it's nothing... until something really bad happens (gets hurt, death)
3. It escalates to open violence. It reaches a destructive end. The seemingly harmless thing is the only survivor, gets up, and leaves.
