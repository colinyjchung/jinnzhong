**Based on**: _On Monday of Last Week_ by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie - source: _The Thing Around Your Neck_ (2009).

1. POV gets job/task/assignment in alien environment. It's weird and there's a "forbidden fruit" character (talked about but not seen, which serves as the story's MECH)
2. POV reflects on all the cost they paid, what they lost in order to get this opportunity. Reflects on mismanaged expectations, misunderstood benefits, justifies how they got this job/task/assignment for money, a girl, or a favor... but begins to doubt their own decision making process.
3. The MECH character appears. It is magic. There is instant connection, lust, and/or renewed sense of identity.
4. POV gets alone time with the MECH. It is tense, awkward, the MECH is in total control with vague, alluring promises.
5. Next day, someone new in alien environment. MECH ignores POV, pays all attention to new person. POV realizes they were toyed with.
