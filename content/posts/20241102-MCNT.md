These are characters you simply cannot please no matter how much you try.

## Malcontent Characters
* The solution you chose solves X, but hurts Y
* The solution you chose makes the problem worse in ways you didn't see
* The solution you chose causes complaints
* The solution you chose is too drastic, too fast, too slow
* The solution you chose is inconvenient to you and they don't want that
