* **Sam's Old DESIRE** - figure out Orpheus tech and find the Alpha. New DESIRE - figure out if Adam Cheswick turned Sarah into a werewolf. Investigate Adam.
* **James' DESIRE** - Police looking at us. Don't want cops looking into the interdimesional stuff as well. VPD vs. Vampires/Werewolves. Bring a fruitbasket! Find a cop willing to work with to defuse. Who may be a hunter.
* **Kassie's DESIRE** - Dig into Orpheus and how to travel to a different plane. 
* **George's DESIRE** - Find a contact for Orpheus to learn more about other side

## STORY SECTION
* Kassie hacks VPD servers to find two cops that have filed paranormal incidents. Hassan Magal, patrolman (reported seeing things was given stress leave) & Jing Xiao, constable (had complaints against them, witness tampering, coercion. Put on temporary leave).
* Sam is tethering to Kassie's 5G. 
* George is reaching out to sergeant Douglas. Ask him about Orpheus. "Bunch of eggheads, very corporate, not fun to work with. I got a guy." Reached out to MonsterX. Old boss is being a dick. Tries intimidation. "Chucklefucks. Bunch of Nerds." Went to the other side. You want weapons, go get a job and buy some. Promises free field reports. Jacob Wallace, ex-South African merc. Gives George an off-books mission. To taste a spray/repellent against vampire, werewolf, and ghost. 
* Sam - talking to parents of Sarah. Sarah was married. Thinks she killed her husband. Asks Kassie to look up Adam Cheswick. Tech startup guy. Mid 40s. Car crash in early 20s, permanent limp. Known as hard environmental activist. Upstanding, Leaves working with corrupt company. Arrested for protesting and financial crime. Nothing supernatural. Known for backing eco-terrorists. When he was inside a box. Period of three months where cell phone had no activity. Kept a low profile. 
* ROLL FOR "Werewolves" - Silver yes. Werewolves aren't all overly aggressive. They don't all transform uncontrollably. They have healing abilities. "Why does Adam limp?"
* Sam asks James if they can visit Adam together. They go to the office building during the day. Go up to Rainmaker. Adam is talking on the phone. Adam surprised with James barging in. Was in box for three months. James blames him for Evelyn's death. Call me garoux. 
* Sam eavesdrop from outside office. George talks. George is nicer. Adam explains (unnecessarily) we are not friends. George is asking for werewolf enemies. James offers weapons. Adam is interested. Sam "accidentally" drops a picture of Sarah in front of Adam to see if he reacts. He does.
* ROLL for OCCULT/RESOLVE - what is astral projection? Can I travel to a different plane. Find articles by professor at UBC. Name is Aurora Peltonen, in Computer Science. Written articles as metaphysics and teleportation. Forum posts. Call Aurora. Lie about needing help on computer stuff. Offer to help with computer stuff. Downtown Arbutus cafe. 530PM.
* James goes after Jing Xiao. See if he has predictable routine. Jing gets pizza from South Granville every lunch. James see Jing comes out. Middle age, overweight. We cast Ma Dong Seok. Sam already briefed James on his corruption. Kassie's profile also gave James names of complainants. James drops names. Jing is curious, but recognizes James Murphy.  Jing is roped in. James asks for investigation into our Vampire stuff (the Jack Poole plaza riot) to be put away. James hints at supernatural stuff that could open a huge can of worms. James promises to fail upwards. Jing needs someone to be blamed, James names head of rival gang in Surrey... or offers if James comes in to talk.
* Kassie gets a ride from George to Arbutus cafe. Dr. Peltonen shows up. Offers projects. She's very passionate about technology. She takes it very seriously. Trying to read her. How important technology is, and thinks it's always for the better. Into blockchain, A.I., and quantum... even beyond moral repercussions. Meander convo to astral/teleportation. She believes in it. Invites George over. Dr. Peltonen, small skinny woman. White hair with streaks of blonde. Not a lot of jewelry.
* George talks about Orpheus as if they suck. They look past the shroud between living and dead. They're not astral walking. George shares stories. Dr. Peltonen is skeptical. What do you know and why is it better than Orpheus. It's not the spirit world. It's just another dimesion. Just like Shadow, Umbra, Astral plane? Elemental Spheres? So much more than what they're perceiving. They're looking at small piece. Ask about k33tz.  Tomorrow night - emails (phone that's  nothing you've seen before running a custom OS) address. Access memory. Metaphysics. Machine I've built. George accidentally reveals she needs to test repellent on werewolves. Dr. Peltonen tells her to go to Stanley Park at midnight on a full moon nonchalantly. Vampires - emails address (storage facility, locker 12, during the day).
* James - finds out Hassan is night patrol. Works on movie sets. It's late 1AM. Shooting Twilight 8. Pattinson and Stewart are still making them in this universe. No. Mnority Report 2. More Minorities. "minority report". Burrard Bridge. Budget to shut it down. Hassan is directing traffic. Raincoat/umbrella. We know they saw a vampire.
* James talks to Hassan. Young, fit, bored, one earring. James drops the blood stuff. Freaks out Hassan. Recognizes James Murphy. Infamy. Escorts James off set. James drops the fact someone close to him was killed at church. James attempts to persuade Constable Magal to join our group. Hassan wants to talk to James during the day.
* Sam wants to confront the people with the mirror. Talks to elder. Throws out he knows Elder is connected to supernatural and mirror travels to different location. You saying I have a magic mirror? ROLL SUCCESSES on talky talk. Drops Garou. Tells Elder about Nature Liberation Force. Elder doesn't know werewolves. It sounds like he's talking about eco-terrorist groups. Sarah stays in the basement and I keep her safe. But don't let people know she's here. Used to run with her in logging days. Chain to trees. Blockades. Always showed up and helping. Sam confesses everything. Elder is a huge skeptic. Tells Sam I don't want to see you. Elder is a deadend.
* NEXT DAY: Meeting with Adam's person. Package for George. Woman from Adam - cut jeans. Leather jacket, tassels on shoulders. Sarah - "Adam says you got guns for us?"
