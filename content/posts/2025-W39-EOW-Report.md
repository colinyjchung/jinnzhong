## Anti-Goal Cycling

* So big news. I submitted [prj:SAVED](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-saved/) to eleven literary magazines that were open. What threw me off was how much time, energy, and psychological bandwidth it ended up taking up. Monday morning, just pulled the trigger on Kenyon Review. It was scary. I double, triple-checked that boilerplate cover letter as if my life depended on it. I had a funny line I was really really really tempted to include making fun of these sample letters that all say "I earned my MFA from XXX in XXXX" and I was going to be snarky about it, but ultimately, I was like, no. I'll be professional and devoid of character in my professional communications as a professional writer, and act professional. Then I spent a lot of Monday refining that SubTrk in between meetings, and when I came home, against better judgment (as it was a gym day the next day), I submitted to everything else that was open minus Granta. I wanted to change the spelling for Granta to The King's English because it's a British magazine, sorry, literary journal, but found I only had two words to change. (I also changed one particular word that now I regret not changing for all the other submissions). ANYWAY -- Slept in Wednesday. Thursday and Friday was an attempt at trying to break stories, but as I said in the first sentence... I was surprised at how much psychological bandwidth doing something new and uncomfortable and I deeply care about where I have so much emotional stakes invested into it.
* So that's that. Let's get back to work cracking next stories.
* NF asked for help with a presentation.

* More chaos at work. A bit too early for my one-revolution-per-quarter schedule. Dinner on Friday with my parents for my father's birthday. Energy levels low. That's it.


## Story Introspection

* Finished _Call Me By Your Name_ (2007) by Andr√© Aciman. It was [very good](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/commentary-call-me-by-your-name-2017/).
