See grandfather. Calls out and voice garbled as if underwater. Grandfather warns her to go. George goes upstairs, watch is in color and substantial. Sky is filled with ghosts. Weird deformed ghosts dragging spiritis into a massive whirlpool.
* Sam detects emotional measure. We need to get rid of bodies. Cremate. Clean up.
* Break into West End apartment. Wait in garage. They drive in instead of out. Sam gets into security office. Pull fire alarm, they don't come out.
* Sleep a day. James tries to get guns and bombs. Gets a bomb. Put bomb inside an ammo box. With a remote trigger. Evelyn calls Andre. Andre~demands a pound of flesh. Plans for two cars.
* Back at original HQ with Ivan. Headed case to Andre. Bing goes into the building. Ivan comes out. Asked to verify the contents. Sam, Evelyn, and James run. Ivan "not a shithead" is fucked up. Andre takes damage and almost dies. Players take four damage. Lexus rolled over and on fire. Ivan groans. Rodney has gun at George's back.
* George elbows Rodney. Gets away. James puts stake slowly through Ivan. Evelyn calls dad to crush Andre's head. Evelyn shoots shotgun guy, shotgun guy shoots dad. Sam picks up stick on fire and hits shotgun guy.
* George dodges a gunshot, second action swings her katana, Nine damage on Rodney, cuts off his hand. James continues to drive stake into Ivan, three more damage. James hushes Ivan.

* George swings Rodney's head off. James finishes Ivan. Andre grabs Bing's arm and stops him. Andre blood whip on Walter's and decapitates him. Sam douses shotgun guy in alcohol and lights on fire. Catches fire. Stops, drop, and rolls. Evelyn walks up to Andre and fires into his head after failing to activating the artifact.
* FINAL ROUND: Sam shoots shotgun guy while he tries to grab the gun. Shotgun guy is dead. Evelyn gets four damage, somehow Andre avoids. Punches Evelyn so hard her neck breaks. James fires desert eagle into Andre. Staggering. George comes in and decapitates Andre. James makes one final check.
* Evelyn wakes up, dripping with liquid, naked. Middle aged gentleman carries me into the swirl.
* George's home... Orpheus people all dead on the floor. Several shadows looming over them.
