**Based on**: _Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers_ by Alyssa Wong - [source](https://www.nightmare-magazine.com/fiction/hungry-daughters-of-starving-mothers/)

1. POV is a predator with an interesting MECH. A hunt is dramatized but this one feeds the POV more "potently". It's addictive and the POV wants more.
2. POV goes hom to someone who is "good", someone who loves, cares for, and is kind to the POV. POV is afraid of hurting them (as they are killers), so POV pushes them away.
3. POV visits their past mentor, teacher, or parent. The mentor knows the POV tasted something they shouldn't have. Mentor tells POV to live a simpler, safer, and more predictable life. Invites POV to come back home. POV rejects this.
4. POV meets a predator who's more experienced than POV. Invites POV to a secret club of other predators. They have parties, rituals, or rites where they treat the hunt at a higher, more religious or hedonistic way. It's organized, systematic, with SOPs and stuff. It's not lone wolf freelance. It's "the future" of their kind.
5. For REASONS, the "good friend" from 2 ends up a victim at one of these parties/rituals and POV tries to save them, but fails. Regrets.
