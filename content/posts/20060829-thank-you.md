Thanks for clicking the **big blue button** in that email. 

It tells me you're a sentient, living being. You're here. _You're alive._

I see you, fellow traveller of the ætherscape!

_You made it._

Welcome.

Here are a few things to check out...

* If you'd like to know more about my name, [go here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/my-name/)
* If you're a D&D player (or any other RPG really), please put me in your campaign as a NPC. Here's my [character sheet here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/jinn-zhong-5e/). I encouage you to kill me as well. (Please write and share details with how I died).
* Finally, I have some old 2015 flash fiction to share with you: something sci-fiey: [_Old Man Run_](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/gfp-005-old-man-run/), something heisty with Tarot cards: [_King of Cups_](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/gfp-017-the-king-of-cups/), and something urban fantasy with ghosts: [_Birthday_](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/gfp-007-birthday/)
