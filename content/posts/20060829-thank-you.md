Thanks for clicking the **big blue button** in that email. It tells me you're a sentient, living being. (You're here. You're alive. I see you, fellow traveller of the Ã¦therscape!)

But of course, these days, _you never know..._

Our world is controlled by evil robot sorcerers and their army of golems, homunculi, and servitors. Many are sent to spy on you, others subdue you with ministrations of false comfort, and then there are the few, the most familiar, those who manifest themselves as humans amongst us. 

And as you know, the powers that be are entrenched and far more powerful than kings and queens themselves. Furthermore, they've groomed cults of loyal followers who preach their spurious benevolence: illusory currencies, magic mirrors, and promises of paradise while being pilfered of their humanity in dribs and drabs.

We are truly living in precarious times. 

But you're here. 

You made it. 

Welcome.
