**Based on**: _The Fluted Girl_ by Paolo Bacigalupi - source: _Pump Six and Other Stories_ (2008).

1. POV is a vulnerable person/sentient-creature who's being experimented on and hiding. POV is an "expensive asset" (we don't know what's going on). POV gets caught and is brought to the boss who's coordinating an event. Hints at showcasing the POV.
2. POV reflects on how they were caught/enslaved/in-this-situation, reflects on a friend who expanded the POV's perspective on the "larger world" or the "outside".
3. The event begins. A lot of rich/powerful people show up. Flashback to friend who gives POV an "out" (poison, escape hatch, hiding place, something).
4. REVEAL what the POV's experiment was for, there's a performance of MECH, and how they will be auctioned off. REVEAL in flashback how friend was murdered, vanished, or hurt.
5. POV considers using the "out". But executes a "twist" to get vengeance in an unexpected way.
