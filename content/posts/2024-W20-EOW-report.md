## Highlights This Week

* This was an extremely rough week. After last week's physical [realization](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/2024-w19-eow-report/) - like _feel it in my bones_ realization - that I was hitting a wall on several fronts, I think I crashed. I went from a month of uncertain anxiety and chasing to a month of overwhelm and hyper-engagement in the newness... while still juggling the "Last Client" and pushing hard to wake up early for the 30m of fiction daily. So this week, I fell into my "comfort food" of story theory. Because I'm working on naming conventions and tagging at work, I have somehow fell into a parallel of it with fiction as well. So I'm figuring out the "tagging elements" in all those [THBs I posted](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/thb/) last week. I get it. It's procastination disguised as theoretical education. I am avoiding because I'm stuck, insecure, and unsure of [prj: MINOS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-minos/). And yet, here we are.
* I finished my second reading of _Never Let Me Go_ ([commentary here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/commentary-never-let-me-go-2005/)). Played a [session](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/rcr-htr-e11-sam-the-softie/) of Hunter the Reckoning (three months after the last one). Finished S2 of _The Bear_.
* To add to the "comfort food" of categorizing, tagging, and organizing... I posted (via backdating) all 39 episodes of the original run of [Garage Fiction](https://www.patreon.com/garagefiction) on Patreon behind the paywall. I also looked at the second run when we expanded the cast significantly. That [publishing schedule](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/gfp-2.0-publishing-schedule/) was... insane. There were times when we were posting eight episodes a month as a group. And also -- because of the GFP convos with Olivia, I watched the first three episodes of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ (1997-2003) again. Like I said, comfort food. That's where I'm at this past week.

ZERO PROGRESS this week!!!

## EOW Time Tracking

In this section, I track daily actions (axn) and emotions (emo), aiming for just 30 minutes of fiction work a day. If time permits, more is done. AXN emoji legend in footnote[^2].

| day | axn | emo | ntes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| SUN | :skull: | :sleeping: | Worn down a bit from doing the THBs last week, and pushing so hard since 3/13 |
| MON | :skull: | :weary: | Fell into "theory trap" as comfort food due to exhaustion |
| TUE | :skull: | :weary: | Ditto. |
| WED | :skull: | :weary: | Ditto. |
| THU | :skull: | :weary: | Ditto. |
| FRI | :skull: | :weary: |  Ditto. |

I don't have a ton to add that I haven't already said in the highlights above. I think I just feel worn down. I realized it last Sunday, I _felt_ it this week. I feel winded in the mornings, almost short of breath. I'm wondering if it's retroactive echoes from last year this same time when I was miserable. May 2023 was just no good. It was the few months before the U.K. trip that would really break a lot of things open, the most important being the [journaling on trains](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/art-pop-nerds-and-story/) in Scotland. I mean, it's _probably_ not that and the last two months of sprinting. But it does bear some resemblance. Another factor might just be the daily streaks. Storygraph is up to [83 days](https://app.thestorygraph.com/streak/colinyjchung), daily stretching on Habitca the same. I think when a daily habit goes this long, as it had on Wordle last year, I just want to break it for the sake of breaking it... which is weird. I dunno. I often think about Buster Benson's "[Live Like a Hydra](https://buster.wiki/blog/2013/08-24-live-like-a-hydra/)" article from 2013. Especially after so many intense cycles over the last few years. Maybe I'm cycling into recovery mode again.

The only think I can tell myself is to keep going, but perhaps at a slower, gentler speed, but keep going regardless.

[^2]: The most important objective of the **EOW Time Tracking** is to ensure that hours dedicated to  fiction writing actually move stories forward for just thirty minutes a day minimum. It is also to ensure "fiction-related" activities (like consuming more craft education, excessive world-building research, and working on marketing stuff) doesn't count.
