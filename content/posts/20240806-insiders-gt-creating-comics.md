* Tell the story first (communicate necessary information), _THEN_ make it entertaining. Don’t entertain for the sake of it. Story first.
* Scenes must have turning points. A change in which new action can move forward. Negative to positive. Positive to negative. Multiple points. (Yes, but. No, and. Yes, and. No, but). 
* The turning point can’t simply be surface plot. An internal emotional change must occur.
* One action per panel.
* vertical vs horizontal grid. Focal point and Lines of sight. Dead space. Gutters
* Reference point objects help position where characters are and where they’re standing 
* Speed lines and motion blurs.
* Affected objects like rope, chains, webbing, or otherwise can create the illusion of movement without speed lines or motion blur. The pose also needs to be dynamic.
* You can recreate camera in motion. Side-to-side is a dolly. Objects move as you dolly from panel to panel. Tracking is like steady cam. Pan  is when camera pivots.
