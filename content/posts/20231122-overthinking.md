So, I'll be honest. The frustration, anxiety, and fear of not starting or writing anything still is starting to boil over in a bad way. On one hand, I still feel like I haven't found a magic formula to get started... like the core elements exercise I did a couple weeks ago when I studied all the top award-winning short stories. On the other hand, I also realize that last statement is the essence of my over-analytical, over-preparation, over-cautious approach that didn't work in 2006, and it didn't work in 2015, and it didn't work in 2017. Like, rationally, I know what finally made me get good at copy was simply charging money and doing it because my income was on the line... and the exact same approach of throwing wind to the caution and just DOING IT would get me on the path to getting good at the craft of writing stories and fiction as well... but the emotional side of me, the subconscious, or whatever side of me is hunting for more education still. It keeps saying, "just one more". Just this course. Just find this one other thing.

And that's what I did last weekend. I caught up on and binged two SIWC videos. Cecily Lyra's workshop on hooks and John Wiswell's workshop on short story triangulation. Did it make me feel like I had progressed? Of course. That's the drug of education. You think you've filled in my gaps, you think you've found a new tool, you think you're better prepared. Education is a trap when it comes to craft. I knew this going into this third iteration of writing fiction. And yet, here I am again. Back in April or May when I discovered the Scriptnotes ep. 403, I was like. OK. That's good. That's it. I don't need more. I'll listen to this six or seven times and take notes and really let it sink in. But then I still felt like not knowing how to nagivate the middle. So I stumbled on to Brandon Sanderson's "Promise, Progress, Payoff". OK, Oh wow. This is like writing a joke. I get it now. But wait. There are several types of these plot archetypes. So then I listened to almost fifty episodes of Writing Excuses, season eleven where they go through it all. But then I realized Save the Cat Goes to the Movies has a better taxonmy for plot archetypes.

And then I listened to Sanderson's BYU lectures twice. And John Pedersen told me to listen to Craig Mazin talking about Last of Us. And now I'm like, maybe I need to watch MRK's short story class and take Richard Thomas's Story Mechanics course.

I've been here before. This was 2007-2010 when I bought every copywriting, marketing, traffic, product development, wealth building class there was so I could be the most knowledgeable marketing consultant on the planet. It is an addiction.

Fortunately, I also had bills to pay. So I landed clients, did work, and kept learning. Fiction, unfortunately, doesn't pay. Not enough to live at any standard of living except the most indigent. It is a black swan. And I'm very much aware it is and it's worth chasing, but there's a lock in my head after fifteen years of freelancing. I feel like I've accepted that this is a hobby. It's a funy hobby. But it's still a hobby that I want to get GOOD AT and I would still like the validation and recognition of peers, gatekeepers and fans. Which means I want to submit stories to pro-rate zines. Which means, i don't want to embarass myself with bad storytelling. Which means, I am putting my reputation on the line and that. That's where the procrastiation and drowning in education comes from. I am not getting monetary compensated and that just makes it... even more weighted on the reputation. The ego.

I dropped my ego for copywriting/marketing fifteen years ago. Didn't have time or energy for it. I thrashed forward regardless of shame, humiliation, or quesy feelings about what I wrote. It didn't matter because the only think that mattered was that the copy got results, I got paid, and paid well. Life is simple, but also crude and ruly, when profit is your only metric. With fiction, given the lack of money, the only metric then becomes this vague, subjective thing of "artistic integrity". The vision, the intent, the raw emotional honesty, the themes and what you're saying. your voice.

Maybe that's another reason why I'm still procrastinating. I've started to fade from all the Discord servers. I've kept the social/support stuff to once every six weeks for Garage Fiction and once a month for the VGW meetups. Are they still driving me forward? I think so. I think the shame of being in these groups and still not writing helps move me forward. The fact I don't have to critique, or manage, or organize much... that keeps the obligations low, unlike GFP2.0 where running that thing became another wonderful excuse for not writing. Not doing the actual thing.

The key here is to drop the education stuff AS WELL so that I have no choice but to stand naked in front of the craft. 
So maybe the decision point here is to NOT watch MRK's short story workshop and purchase anymore of Richard Thomas's Story Mechanics. Maybe I can review them later after I've attempted the craft, but they go on the backburner for now.
In a way, it's making a stand and facing my own creative demons. Dropping the education, the marketing/business, the organizing/socializing. 

With that said though.

I can't dismiss what I learned via the Wiswell workshop on short story triangulation and Lyra's workshop on hooks. Let's spend today summarizing what I learned so far and applying it to the eleven short stories from two weeks ago.

One last hit. If you will.
