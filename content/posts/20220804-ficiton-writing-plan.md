On previous iterations, I had zero "world building" and built the world + characters + scenes as if I leapt off the cliff and constructed a plane while I fell.

My new theory is to fill my head and notebooks with world mechanics, characters, potential scenes first based on real world knowledge.

As such, I will devote time to research first...

* 1st - warfare
* 2nd - small unit tactics
* 3rd - daily life 
 
This will hopefully create a living, breathing D&Dish team. (A squad of 12?) And with the last point, this will create a shared, live-in experience for the characters.

* 4th - history during times of warfare - oppression and resistance

That will then inform the characters who come from broken, oppressed people shattered by internecine warfare (caused by secret power? Evil empire? Hidden cabal?) who manipulate people for their own gain. It's this power that "assigns" quests to the smallfolk to keep them in perpetual false hope, keep them under control.

The stories must have an element of hope though. It is about friendship - people who grew up together.

In order of priority...

**Books on War Tactics

Medieval warfare, combined arms, small unit tactics -- create a new way in which combat would be conducted if magic were real. Books on small elite teams to maintain the "small group" cohesion of a cast of characters.

**Books on Daily Life in Medieval/Renaissance Times

Read books on daily life history to create grit and realism. Books on war histories to get story grist. Books on history in general to get philosophical insights, a unique POV.

This will allow me to "steal" scenes and characters. The philosophy gives it depth.

**Books on Occupied/Repressed States

Great setting with clear enemies a la Star Wars / Hunger Games. Goblins/Orcs as occupied Afghanistan a la Dune?
