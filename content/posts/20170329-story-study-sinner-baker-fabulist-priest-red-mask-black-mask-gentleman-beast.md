## SCENE ONE (156)
Strange prologue of choosing a mask to decide who to be. Section Title: Marigold is for Murder. Protagonist chooses the Yellow Mask made from the pelt of a mute animal.

## SCENE TWO (417)
Wife has a pretty mask, but her thighs are fat. But Prot still wants her. He offers cream to her. Wife is pissed off. Wife blames shop girls for stealing. Prot thinks shop girl was honest. Prot thinks about how hot the shop girl is, but this wife is lumbering. Prot pulls out the Iolite Bronze and is determined to smear it on her wife’s privates. She backs away. But Prot persists. Wife pulls out a knife and stabs him, over and over again.

## SCENE THREE (814)
Section Title: Blue is for Maidens. The Prot wakes up the next morning to choose another mask. Prot is a girl this time and is talking to a friend. Prot is talking about marriage and how she won’t do it. They’re stalking the shop and see the delivery truck. There are many different scents. They go in despite Prot’s protest that they shouldn’t sample stuff if they can’t afford it. The shopkeeper talks to her. He talks to her and mentions the three jars Prot bought yesterday. This is taboo. You’re not supposed to talk about encounters of your other masks. Prot runs. Prot goes home to cry. And we hear more about the world building, the unmasking hour, the gendarmes. 

## SCENE FOUR (885)
Section Title: Black is for Sex. A gendarme has arrived and told Prot that today she’s being called to the Queen for prot’s civic duty. She puts on the sable mask. Prot dances with the queen. They talk about the buffet. Queen leads prot to the couch to mate, but delays. She wants prot to talk to her. She asks if prot has a favorite mask. Is this a trap? All of them are precious to him. Some people bend rules. Queen is “SOUNDING BOARD” for the world’s rules here. They have sex. Afterwards, prot reports to Mask Makers to get a new one. The Mask Makers have ugly, soft countenances.

## SCENE FIVE (338)
Section Title: Orange is for Agony. Wears a saffron mask today. Prot is in a jail. It’s small. Prot can’t pace. Prot must remain fat? Neighbor urinates. Workers come and traps the neighbor. They open him up and flay him. He has no noise because he is mute. They take his skin away. Then it’s the prot’s turn to be skinned alive.

## SCENE SIX (1050)
Section Title: Jasper is for Jilting. Prot chooses a mask randomly because prot is tempted to skip this process today and just stay home. Prot is a he today. He’s under the window of a balcony where he’s courting his lover. They talk about marriage. She’s coquettish and accuses him of only wanting to slather her with Queen’s Honey. Prot asks what he can do to prove himself. She asks if he has a jar. She gives him a test. A game. They will poke a hole in the jar so they can’t use it but the scent will fill the room making him super horny. If he can resist fucking her, then they’ll fuck. If not, then you can sleep with my servant instead. The servant girl opens the door, takes the Queen’s Honey away, and rubs it on her privates. She whispers, “want me?” and she runs away. There’s a chase scene through a dormitory block, market district, rural outskirts. In a shaded copse, she drops to her knees. They fuck. Afterwards, she tears off her mask. Then she tears of his mask. He has no idea how to act. No identity. He’s lost!

ACT ONE: 46% - Prot with no Stakes/Trigger… because we have no idea what’s going on.
OR SO IT SEEMS - I missed it the first go-round. Prot is in a pattern, and the pattern is breaking.
The trigger character appears in scene 3. And the aftermath is he has withdrawal issues, wants another mask already. He’s done with the mask already.

## SCENE SEVEN (1444)
She throws prot’s mask away, then peels off the membrane insides of her mask and puts it on the prot. But the prot has no identity either. It doesn’t tell him how to act or what to do. She explains, “there’s no oversoul there.” Prot realizes how animated her bare face is. It repulses him. The mask has no personas, relationship scenarios nor motives. It has an obedience imprint too to stop him from reaching for his mask. It’s also unremovable. He asks why. Then threatens. Then begs. She asks big questions like have you ever wondered who you are beneath it all? He feels relief because he has been having these thoughts. But the guilt is still there. She can read his face. And promises that he can too, over time. She smiles and it repulse him to see skin and teeth move that way. They walk. He figures out that she’s been following him with multiple masks. She gives him her own name. The whole concept of a NAME and an INDIVIDUAL is shocking to him. They go to a hut, and in the hut is a hidden staircase. They go down. She tells him there was a time before the masks. She’s there to liberate him but he doesn’t want to be liberated. Aren’t you tired of choosing masks and wearing them every day? There’s a door at the bottom of the stairs. They go through.

## SCENE EIGHT (1055)
They are beneath the palace at the Mask Maker’s guild. Prot refuses to go in. This is highly illegal and prohibited. She says, I’ve been following you right? At the skinning, who do you think i was? Prot assumes one of the skinners. But she admits to being the neighbor. He’s shocked. She explains her actions as a reflection of herself. She is attributing morals to who she is. This throws him. They go in and see a huge crafts supply room. This is the excess room, where the named steal stuff. She explains the masks even more. How they stimulate thoughts, trigger emotions, assign personality traits. Then she explains how the Named have been working as a rebellion. One mentor, one recruit. Nobody can give up anybody. Then she explains that gendarmes will KILL you if you get caught. Not the kind of killing like when you have a mask on… but ACTUAL KILLING. They come to a wall, and Pena needs to bleed on it to make it open. There’s an ornate chair and on the chair is the First Queen’s Mask. 

B-WORLD: 31% - Prot is led around by NEW ALLY. EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED

## SCENE NINE (265)
Section Title: Diamonds are for Death. Pena asks that he puts on the mask for all the answers. He asks, what if I refuse? She says, you can go back to your old life. What if I report you? Pena says, really? How are you going to do that? Pena repeats that it’s up to him to do it. He puts it on.

## SCENE TEN (522)
The Big Reveal. Queen has won the war. Scientist have figured out immortality. Queen doesn’t have to keep making babies anymore. But the soldiers. They’re not smart. They’re all rules and physical stuff. So let’s create the gendarmes. Uh oh. New problem. My consorts. They feel neglected and adrift now that I don’t have to fuck them all the time. And they’re creating factions and vendettas. They all want to fuck me. I’ll have to ask scientists to create something to make them want to fuck each other instead. NEW PROBLEM! Someone killed someone! We are an aggressive people. I can’t deny that. Ah ha. SOLUTION: Make them switch up identities and get their fill of sex and violence without an identity. But even I am not immune to the effect of the masks. I will now be part of the colony. I will put my oversoul in a mask that nobody will use and hide it in a room that can only be opened by my blood.

## SCENE ELEVEN (461)
Prot takes off the mask and genuflects towards Pena. But Pena’s like I’m not the Queen. We’re all of the same blood? We’re all children of incest. They must escape before the gendarmes come. But it’s too late. Pena pushes the prot into a closeted hole and fills him with a jasmine oil to mask him. The gendarmes get her. The penalty for treason is death. Do you wish to repent? You must identify your co-conspirators. If you do, you can go back to the way of the mask. Pena refuses. They stave her face in with their fists. They completely wreck her.

## SCENE TWELVE (337)
Section Title: The Last Mask. Prot steps out, picks up Pena’s mask, starts crying uncontrollably. He picks up Pena’s mask. He somehow gets home. He takes off his mask because he has real feelings now. He destroys all his masks. 

## SCENE THIRTEEN (254)
Wearing the servant girl’s mask, prot goes to the lover’s quarters. Then he finds a mallet. And smashes her face in. He knows how to kill people now. And this is his game. He’s going to be chaos.
