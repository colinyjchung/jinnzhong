The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _Helpmeet_ (2022) by Naben Ruthnum. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. 

**SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** (_obviously_).

* The way Ruthnum doesn’t quite explain the disease at first… and then gradually shows you the repulsive symptoms of “petals and flakes” and parts of Edward’s body simply falling off or apart is just deliciously paced. You’re grossed out by 15 pages in. And Ruthnum doesn’t let up… you want chills from reading something disgusting, like that shiver down your spine and goosebumps on your arms from seeing slow, tortuous bodily harm? You got it right here. 
* Helpmeet is an old word used in the KJV to describe a woman or wife as “suitable help” for a man. Later it would be more of any kind of helpmate, but the sexist overtones are inherent in the word. And in this novella, the role of Louise is clear. To take care of her husband who is literally falling apart and dying slowly. We quickly find out Edward constantly cheated on Louise and went to brothels. So he’s not much of a husband, but Louise still does her duty as a helpmeet.
* Don’t stick your dick in supernatural pussy.

Lines I Highlighted
* she rounded the couch to press the glass of water into his hand
* Tom Horgan spoke as though compelled, and it would have been rude to stop him.
* intermittent throbbing beacon
