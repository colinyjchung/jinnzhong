[^2]: G was clumsy at first, but then she kept knocking down the highways on purpose.

[^4]: Played Ottoman. Pestered by Spain the entire game. This really annoying player who kept attempting to gaslight me. Brother was Britain, and allied with France at one point b/c said Spain player was _that_ annoying. HRE just played it cool in the background and won. Had dinner with the France player later. Cool guy from Portland. Civil Engineer.
[^5]: Played this when designer B.D. started a _scheduled_ 18XX game without us? That was such a weird dick move. Never went to Trumpeter event after this. Totally turned off by his attitude.
[^6]: My first hex-and-counter! And solitaire too! Couldn't possibly be another better introduction to H&C games. [AAR here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/aar-celles-the-ardennes-2012-g01/)
