## STORY

* On ship Derelict. Orcs just spore. Generations of them. Building idols for their gods. Fight, kill, scheme, and howl for a place in heaven. Ships crashed into it are now part of it. Seven warring hulls. There are elves and humans on board. So big it has its own gravity well and sucks in random ships. Every 24 hours lights will turn on. 12 hours they turn off. Every 24 hours a prophecy of doom.
* Warboss / Hull boss. Hull King. Dwarven mining ship crashed into Derelict four days ago and hasn't stopped moving. The drill is still moving and cutting through the ship.
* At least a crew of 100 dwarves + robots. We don't understand dwarves. 
* Wurka and Joe the Dog. Mub. Blegh and Allen the Dog. Franzzz.
* When Orks believe in something, it's true.
