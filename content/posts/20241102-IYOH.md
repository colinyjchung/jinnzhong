Situations where you're in over your head

## In Over Your Head
* The enemy is smarter, more powerful, stronger, more intelligent, more dextrous, more efficient than you
* You simply don't have the resources to play this game (money, social currency, bandwidth)
* Your skill level isn't there
* You don't have the qualifications, membership levels, or status to play this game
* You haven't proven your value, and the game is rigged to prevent that
