OK, so I'm condensing the five arcs in K.M. Weiland's _Creating Character Arcs_ (2016) even further.

{{< toc >}}

## Positive Arc
### STS
* The LIE thrives here and keeps PROT stuck. In denial via DREAM arc. Contrast this with BWO in the future.
* Opening Scene is PROT doing what they're good at because of LIE, but then DSR is introduced, and it hints at WANT, which sets off PROG. 
* 2nd Scene (or Sequence) is resistance, reluctance, or reorientation.
### BWO
* The First Exploration in DREAM arc (first step physically into new world, first encounter with what was hinted at, first scope expansion of MECH, first cycle of doing the new thing, first use of GIFT)
* Old rules of LIE no longer apply -- what used to empower, enable, and solve problems -- you actually get punished for acting based on lie.
* A Glimpse of Truth
### MID
* Truth hits them hard. A REALIZATION. A confrontation with self.
* The mirror moment. _Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I made a mistake. Maybe X is more important. Maybe X wasn't lying. On no, I'm actually trapped. I've paid a high cost for this. I can't walk away now._
* There is a moment of acceptance of the TRUTH, the "A" in the DREAM arc.
### 2B to LOW
* When you get what you want but not what you need. Stuck in reverse.
* Beginnings of manifestation of TRUTH in the DREAM arc. But gets punished for using it. They're getting shit-tests for transforming.
* But then the mentor dies, a whiff of death, you reach the dark night of the soul, and you have to face LIE and give it up. Usually driven by ANTG.
### A3 to CMX
* Truth has ruined your life. NEED is expensive short-term. You're making changes.  
* CMX, you must use TRUTH to win. Ultimate manifestation of TRUTH.
* CMX-in-CMX - the one decisive moment audience is waiting for.
## Flat Arc
PROT already knows and lives the TRUTH, but will be tested to breaking point. And it is their resilience that changes the world around them.
### STS
* Normal World is either...
   * **GOOD PLACE** that will be destroyed by end of A1, or PROT forced to travel away to protect it.
   * **BAD PLACE** that's driven by LIE(s) and the PROT with TRUTH will destroy this world to create a better one.
* In the opening scene, introduce the TRUTH instead of LIE.
* PROT probably doesn't have knowledge of LIE yet. Possibly Naive about world.
### BWO
* Discovers the LIE embedded in the world around them, PROT is tempted and has to ask questions about their faith in the TRUTH.
* They get punished for believing in the TRUTH. PROT may even doubt themselves. Maybe the LIE has valid arguments.
### MID
* PROT sees what the ANTG is really up to, how corrupted and powerful the LIE is.
* The "Moment of Truth" here isn't a revelation. It is a deeper insight and renewed resolve that the TRUTH is right.
* Allies, NPCs, and sidekicks start seeing that maybe the PROT has a valid argument and it's worth fighting the LIE.
### 2B to LOW
* PROT has seen weakness in LIE and will exploit it. What keeps the story tense is there are good, valid arguments for both sides and PROT does have doubts even as they push their side of the argument.
* The LOW is not where the PROT doubts the TRUTH. That never happens. But the PROT _will doubt_ whether or not they can actually _use_ the TRUTH to defeat the LIE. The Flat Arc is about whether the CDA prevails against all odds.
### A3 to CMX
* Fortunately, the allies PROT has changed will rally to them. PROT will gather resources, personnel, and have one last long shot at defeating the ANTG and the LIE.
In the CMX of a flat arc, the PROT's resolve of the TRUTH will be met by the ANTG throwing the LIE once again at the PROT.
* The PROT is the catalyst for changes in the allies, but don't let the Positive Arc Ally steal the spotlight.
* If the world was LIE-ridden, it is now destroyed and PROT & Friends can rebuild it. If PROT had to leave "the good place" to protect it, they now return home triumphant.
**SIDE NOTE:** Every major IP in the last 80 years have been flat arc heroes: Frodo Baggins, Peter Parker, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter. They are all young naive PROTs who are unquestionably "good" (courageous, resilient, earnest) and being good helps them overcome the chaos, the LIE-ridden world. It is inspiring. It is also, ultimately, a childish fantasy. Take it one step further, they are messianic figures. Jesus is a childish fantasy. A character that remains good in the face of corrupt evil and prevails, and "saves the world".
## Negative Arcs
Cautionary tales. Unrelenting vice leads to destruction.
1. **DISILLUSIONMENT ARC**: From positive outlook to negative one. The LIE was a positive outlook on X. The TRUTH is realizing X isn't that great.
2. **FALL ARC**: Same as positive arc, but instead of accepting the TRUTH, rejects it and buys an even greater LIE. Story ends in insanity, oppressive immorality, or death.
3. **CORRUPTION ARC**: Starts out in "the good place" where TRUTH thrives, but lured away by a LIE.
You could argue the "seed of TRUTH" was inside PROT for positive arcs, and the "seed of the LIE" was inside the PROT for a  corruption arc, but I don't like that. It's saying people are destined to follow this "seed" when I think the seed could fall either way. But this is a philsophical question.
> _"It's possible to be disillusioned without being corrupted, and it's possible to be corrupted without being disillusioned."_ - William Bernhardt, _Perfecting Plot_

Positive arc is about "redeeming self", flat arc is about "saving others", negative arc is about "destroying self and probably others as well".

In Positive and Flat arcs, characters face down death, come to terms with its power, re-embrace life, and rise again. In Negative Arcs, PROT is impotent in the face of this horror.

**SOME OVERARCHING NOTES**

* **STS**: Audience needs to understand how LIE shapes the PROT's world Both TRUTH and LIE should share the stage simultaneously, even if one is a mere reflection or shadow. Stakes for what happens if LIE is pursued should be discussed, what needs to be sacrificed. Prot can't name LIE or TRUTH yet. Whether it's a TASTE, RUMOR, or GLIMPSE, the PROT sees there is "more than meets the eye".
* **BWO**: PROT becomes increasingly enthralled by the darkness, rather than overcoming it, becomes enslaved to the LIE whereas in the positive arc, they see how the TRUTH could set them free.
* **MID**: Up until now, character has advanced towards the LIE, but also had many chances to turn back. The MID is where PROT is presented with the TRUTH one last time and rejects it.
* **2B to LOW**: PROT aggressively chases the WANT now. May get glimmers of TRUTH in form of resistance or reprimands... but no longer personal obstacle. The LIE-driven goal is most important. (Minus the DISUILLUSIONMENT arc as PROT grows into TRUTH). The LIE grows into its worst manifestation. (lust > adultery/rape, hatred > murder, greed > betrayal).
* **3A to CMX**: The negative arc is about _failure_.  This final act _reeks of death_. Either the PROT and "collateral damage".  LIE has rendered them helpless. They surrender to the LIE and sink deeper. The exception is the DISILLUSIONMENT arc where the truth is dark and horrifying. Once in A3, PROT has no more moral compass and will attempt to seize the WANT in any way they can.
* **CMX**: Everything falls apart. Two possible outcomes:
   * **Pyrrhic Victory**: They get what they want, but it's empty and hollow. Without TRUTH, they can't even figure out how to get what they NEED. There might be a glimpse of TRUTH, making the PROT realize how futile this whole journey was.
   * **Absolute Devastation**: They lose both inner and outer battle. It is total failure and even death.
## DISILLUSIONMENT ARC
### STS
* PROT sees glitter and glamour of the LIE. False promise of hope and success. Temptation. Desire in DREAM arc.
* PROT isn't a total bumpkin. Has a seed of experience, or an ally that symbolizes the TRUTH, and has warned them. PROT simply ignores it.
* PROT gets a TASTE of this LIE-ridden world and it's intoxicating.
### BWO
* PROT gets first full experience of the LIE-ridden world is and completely enthralled by the benefits. Parties, easy access, luxury, magic, whatever.
* But the LIE is hard to get into. It's exclusive, has a lot of barriers, or gatekeepers. PROT is resilient though, and makes headway toward their WANT.
* One of the characters symbolizing the LIE asks for a "small favor", and in return, can get PROT more access. PROT sees cracks, but is fully seduced.
### MID
* In doing the "small favor" PROT is exposed to, or discovers an insight/revelation of the LIE's past/backstory and sees the illusion begins to shatter.
### 2B to LOW
* Disillusionment ramps up. PROT is disgusted and sick of this LIE-ridden world. No longer wants it.
### A3 to CMX
* Collateral damage and/or death (literal, symbolic, or identity). PROT is witness or part of it.
* PROT has realizations about this world and has a "straw that broken camel's back" epiphany due to an incident where characters show their ugly decisions.
* The Main Characrer the PROT was so obsessed with, who took them into the LIE-ridden world, who PROT discovers is a flawed tragic hero, dies.
* Final image is a symbol of how this once glittering seductive world is actually dark and corrupt.
## FALL ARC
Starts in BAD PLACE
### STS
* Like Positive Arc, entrenched in LIE. It is comfortable in homeostasis, maybe even good. But there are cracks.
* The audience may see the cracks in the LIE that PROT doesn't. Character may have positive outlook (or codependency to an ALLY) in the face of great abuse, exploitation, or severe power dynamics.
* PROT should show signs of dark nature (violence, cruelty, selfishness, whatever will lead to fall)
### BWO
* PROT is kicked out or leaves this abusive world even though they "love it" due to Stockholm Syndrome. They are determined to come back better... and go on a track of dark ambition. It's a trainwreck in slow motion.
* The TRUTH slaps them down. The LIE is haunting them. But PROT keeps tenasciously chasing the WANT. May rethink LIE at times.
* PROT begins their journey of enacting vengeance, or whatever plot that's a manifestation of the LIE.
### MID
* Something drastic happens to a character who represents the LIE. Or PROT gets a lifeline to live a good life without the LIE. The PROT rejects it and chooses the LIE.
### 2B to LOW
* The plot PROT started in BWO now goes up to eleven. It's extreme. It makes the audience question the author's mind.
### A3 to CMX
* The PROT completes their evil plot and still feels empty. They got everything they WANT. It didn't resolve anything.
* The emptiness consumes them. They continue to do cruel things to others, lashing out, frustrated that getting what they  WANT didn't bring peace.
* PROT dies, haunted in their final days.
* The lives around PROT are free to maybe hope once more.
## CORRUPTION ARC
Starts in GOOD PLACE
### STS
* PROT's world is already blessed by the TRUTH. There are some drawbacks, but it's a safe place for happiness and growth.
* PROT has doubts or discontentment about this WORLD. There are unfair rules they just "don't get". There may be cracks in the system.
* A CATALYST shows PROT a _DIFFERENT FUTURE_. The CATALYST tempts the PROT, creates a desire for "more" or "better", doubt in the current situation. More power, agency, or new frame.
### BWO
* PROT explores this new, "better" world. Gets an opportunity to "grow" and do more. The pact with the devil has been made.
* Learns more and more about the power of the LIE. Recognizes subconsciously its power in helping them get what they WANT. Obsession with WANT makes them embrace the LIE and reject the TRUTH.
* PROT chafes at the rules of the "better" world as well. Breaks a rule they've set. Doesn't care.
### MID
* Someone PROT trusts attempts to convince them this "mistake" or breaking of rule can still be remedied. They can still fix it, apologize, ask for forgiveness. PROT doesn't listen.
### 2B to LOW
* PROT pays the ultimate cost to protect their WANT and LIE. They do something that is morally reprehensible on a scale that couldn't have been imagined before.
### A3 to CMX
* PROT surrenders fully to the LIE, the dark side.
* PROT follows the orders of the LIE, doing the unspeakable. But it's too late for them. They're fully entrapped by the LIE now and they are servants to it.
* PROT kills the ones they love.
* PROT is imprisoned in their new life, fully devoted to the LIE now.
