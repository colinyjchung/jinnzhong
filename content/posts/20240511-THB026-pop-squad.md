**Based on**: _Pop Squad_ by Paolo Bacigalupi - source: _Pump Six and Other Stories_ (2008).

1. POV is going through a "routine procedure" (ritual, event, process), the MECH. It's weird, disgusting, repulsive, shocking, and/or absurd to us.
2. Reveal why this MECH exists in this world. Is it a technology, magic, or global traumatic event that has put this MECH in place? What are the benefits of this MECH (dramatize it). Have POV argue with someone (friend, lover, colleague, ally) about why anyone would "break the rules" on MECH and jeopardize the benefits of this world. They all agree in nuanced ways and don't "get it".
3. POV begins to have doubts about their job. POV overworks, gets stressed, makes mistakes, partner notices, spouse is annoyed. 
4. POV crisis of conscience pushes them to hunt down a rule-breaker to understand them.
5. POV finds rule-breaker and they talk. The prey is scared, but tells the truth. POV gets a new frame of reference and new perspective.
