I find myself noodling with the MECH way too much during MRK's Sunday morning "Make Me Write" sessions. During the post-MMW call with just the Short Story Cohort... Mary Robinette suggested we rewrite the plot beats of Red Riding Hood, but she also mentioned how she'd have these thumbnails on index cards that are 150 words max with a beginning, middle, and end.

I thought about this a lot and was reminded of a book with 54 situations called _Story Structure Architect_. Yesterday, I pasted the notes up [here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/notes-story-structure-architect-2005-54-situations/). I'm not sure it was super useful. I think it got me one step closer. And then, I remembered this three column thing I made a while back that combined the 54 situations in a way that made more sense to me.

As I was doing this Sunday, I had...

## Three Insights i/r/t Plot Threads & Patterns

* **INSIGHT #1:** Starting from plot structure is stupid. It's too open-ended. You need a concrete, tangible detail or prompt first. That way you can build your MECH, a couple of characters maybe, and a setting. What tripped me up in 2015-2017 is trying to "solve" all these plot patterns and thinking I could start there when it's the SECOND step.
* **INSIGHT #2:** Hyper-related to the first point, starring at a huge list of plot structures is intimidating, overwhelming, and useless. The prompt and/or MECH dictates and/or helps narrow down which plot patterns to "try on" and experiment with.
* **INSIGHT #3:** The [Plot Thread Archtypes](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/plot-thread/) I broke down a few months ago are DIFFERENT form the Plot Patterns I think I'm starting to understand now. Plot Patterns can be applied to any story. They're more like scenes, or a sequence. Plot Thread Archetypes are in that liminal space between genre and plot, of which, some are more hard-coded than others (e.g. Mystery, Romance, Thrillers).

More importantly, i/r/t to the last point, I'm starting to understand (again) that what tools you can functionally use for practical crafting stories is vastly different from what tools are used for analysis and dissection.

As I mentioned above already, right now, I'm stuck on the MECH and can't context-shift to the dramatization and laying down the plot beats. The MECH is still too open for me. I need tools to narrow down the plot beats.

## MICE & Plot Patterns

Last night and this morning, I started going through the list of 54 situations and it became very clear to me that aside from "pure" mystery stories (starts with a crime/inquiry), almost every story starts with an "E" in the MICE quotient. You need to rock the status quo first in order to get the story moving. The inciting incident or disruption (DSR) then, is the first plot beat. 
I've broken them down into five types.

## 5 Types of Inciting Incidents / Disruptions (DSR)

### Prot/Ally Attacked
* Prot or Ally is cursed, poisoned, or injured
* Prot or Ally is abducted, caught, imprisoned, lost, or abandoned
* Prot or Ally is murdered, slain, or wronged

### Comes/Goes to Town
* Stranger comes to town: rival, hero, or new ally
* Reunion: someone PROT knows is coming
* Fish out of Water: PROT goes to new place

### Get A Gift
Gifts can be magical or mundane. **MAGICAL**: talisman, power, fortune, miracle **MUNDANE**: invitation, proposition, school, access, job, contract, meal, ticket, toy, temptation
* Gift is bad, must get rid of or get out of it
* Gift is good, but has unforeseen consequences and side effects
* Gift is unknown quantity, must figure out what it does

### Life Stages
Similar to gifts, but even more mundane life stages: puberty, new love, new friend, birth, death, marriage, divorce, breakup, mid-life crisis, LGBTQ+ coming out, pregnancy, first job, first love, first house, first period, miscarriage, losing virginity, affair, empty-nest, estrangement, addiction, recovery, accidents.

### New Intel
* Warning, rumor, or data that something bad is arriving soon (villain, disaster, bad news)
* See glimpse of truth (often due to being at the wrong place, wrong time). A "behind-the-scenes" truth about how things really work. Or a covered up scandal. Or **discover secret** accidentally (adultery, incest, age, lie, secret job, crime, secret meeting)
* Change of heart or doubt. Routine activity is called into question, loyalty is shaken. Or something new creates temptation, want to find more of it.

## Middles: Mystery or McGuffins
OK, once the DSR occurs, the PROT can choose to ignore it for a while (the reluctance in the Hero's Journey), but I would assume, in a short story, we don't have time for that and the PROT starts moving. In further thinking about this... It seems to me that the middle tends to be Ms (milieu) or Is (inquiries) in the MICE quotient.
| DSR | BWO | DNM |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Prot or Ally hurt| <ul><li>If cure known, **milieu** to go get it.</li><li>If cure unknown, **inquiry** to figure out.</li></ul> | Ally healed or not |
|Prot or Ally lost|<ul><li>If ally, **milieu** rescue mission</li><li>If hero, **milieu** escape mission</li></ul> | Rescue or Escape |
|Prot or Ally wronged|<ul><li>If persecutor known, **event** revenge</li><li>Revenge may be: kill, steal, lawsuit, etc.</li><li>If persecutor unknown, **inquiry** hunt them</li></ul> | Vengeance|
|Stranger to town|<ul><li>If rival, **event** contest</li><li>If stranger, **inquiry** what's up w/them?</li><li>If newbie, **event** train/haze</li></ul> | Stranger leaves or stays|
|Reunion | <ul><li>**event** dredge up past, chars change</li></ul> | Separate |
|Fishâ‰ Water|<ul><li>**milieu**, explore, learn, adapt, climb</li></ul> | Get burnt, survive, or rise to top |
|White Elephant|<ul><li>**milieu**, ring to Mordor</li><li>**milieu** go to place</li></ul>|destroy or destroyed|
|Monkey's Paw|<ul><li>**event**, enjoy in 2a, learn in 2b</li></ul> |return gift or be one with it|
|Mystery Box|<ul><li>**event** figure out what it does</li></ul>| use for good or evil|
|Life Stage|<ul><li>**event** or **milieu** as **char** goes thru DREAM</li></ul>| Self & others accept change or not|
|Warning|<ul><li>**event** prep, defend</li><li>OR **milieu** fetch quest, or solicit help</li></ul>| survived or fended off, or overrun|
|Glimpse|<ul><li>If institution, **milieu** flee and chased</li><li>if ally, **event** confront, blackmail, expose</li></ul> | Secret out or silenced|
|Doubt|<ul><li>Faith shaken, **character** talk to others, tested</li></ul> | restored or leaves |
|Temptation|<ul><li>Wants another hit, **milieu** or **event**</li></ul> | Succcumbs with cost, or resists |

## Inquiries
Questions aside from "who murdered the victim" can be...
* What's up with that mysterious stranger? (asshole, does weird shit, or just outside cultural norms)
* Why do we do this cultural thing? (ritual, rite, or routine is called into question)
* How do I get another hit of this? (PROT experiences something new and tasty, wants more of it)
* What were the side effects (or unexpected consequences) of this? (PROT is in over their heads or made deal with devil)
* How do I find this person, thing, or whatever? (PROT must figure out how to get McGuffin before _going_ to get the McGuffin)
* What's the cure, solution to this? (PROT is faced with a puzzle as an obstacle)

## Horror or Monster in the House as Middle
This is interesting. I feel like you can use "Monster in the House" (MITH) with almost any DSR. The DSR is just bait to lure the PROT(s) into the house so the monster can torture them. The house, obviously, is a milieu. Comes with monster free-of-charge.

## Plot Beats of Middles

### Milieu
* Go get something to save ally's life
* Go save/rescue ally
* Escape from a place
* Explore and adapt to (or get burnt by) new place
* Explore and climb ladder of new place
* Deliver person/thing to new place
* Go to new place(s) to avoid or b/c of life stage
* Flee or run away from ANTG chasing/hunting you
* Go to new place(s) to get stuff

### Inquiry
* Figure out _how_ to save ally's life
* Figure out the new stranger in town
* Figure out what new gift does
* Figure out why we do X (ritual, rite, routine)
* Figure out all the hidden costs of a deal
* Figure out how to find X (person, place, thing)

### Event
* Have contest with rival to proof superiority
* Train/haze new guy and eventually accept/deny them
* Reveal secrets to hurt each other
* Fuck around and find out with new gift
* Resist (or be persecuted by) for new life stage
* Prepare defense for incoming ANTG
* Confront, blackmail, or expose secret
* Face tons of obstacles for wanting X

## CONCLUSIONS
I don't know if this will help. I won't know until I put it into practice, but I have at least 20+ DSRs and 20+ BWOs now. I think with these in my toolkit, I can start aiming towards 3-4 of these as I noodle around with my MECH design on Sunday mornings. We'll see.
