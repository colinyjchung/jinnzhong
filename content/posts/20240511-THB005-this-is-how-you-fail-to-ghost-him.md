**Based on**: _This Is How You Fail to Ghost Him_ by Victoria McCurdy - [source](http://monkeybicycle.net/this-is-how-you-fail-to-ghost-him/)

1. POV sets up a meeting with a stranger - wary, figuring them out
2. The meeting is generic/routine. POV starts lying/trolling/pranking.
3. Back home, sadness/loneliness but it's revealed stranger knew they were lying/trolling/pranking and still wants to connect again. Hope.
