## Highlights This Week

* Back in the swing of work. A _lot_ of hours put in. Learning video editing, not as a doer of it, but as a manager of it. Putting together training for my team of copywriters. Learned... AI this week. Was conflicted, of course (so many reasons wrong with what it is, how it came to be, how it plagiarizes and steals and it's "ok" to them, how tech-bros keep defending it, how tech-billionaires tell us its existential, how destructive it is to the climate, how lovely schadenfraude -- they lost a trillion in market cap recently, just overall how shitty it is in the way they keep forcing it to be used when it is ultimately a net-negative and produces negative value, really)... until I think I've finally justified it to myself: what I do at work is for work, and frankly, copy and content can be junk as long as it works and nobody cares... but 100% agree with Ted Chiang that you [can't make ART with it](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art). But even on the work side, playing with Claude, at best, at best, you'll get 20% of ideas that are acutally any good, and when you make it write content, the sheer amount of prompting and commands you need to feed it, and then _still_ requiring my 15+ years of experience to _discern_ and RECOGNIZE what is good and what is bad... and I end up throwing away most of what it spits back out at me, and rewriting the rest... like did we really end up doing anything faster or more efficient here? So I am still conflicted I guess, to a degree, but have accepted this is just a job.
* Back in the swing of creation as well. Working through the plotting and character arcs for [MINOS](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-minos/). I really should be working on [BECKY](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/prj-becky/) instead though, because it's the perfect candidate for Strange Horizon's call for surveillance themed stories.
* Comics. Just a lot of comics. Organized my pull list. (I know what a "pull list" is now). I also know what FOC is (final order cut-off date). It's looking really long. I mean, yes, a lot of it are miniseries. They'll disappear after 4-6 issues. But it's still long. Doesn't help that I'm slowly getting sucked into the DC universe as well.

Not much. Lots of brainstorming and thinking, but no writing yet. Need to transition into writing too.

This week was just heavy on work. Was in the office until 6 or 7PM, and 8PM on Friday. And this is even though I'm going in earlier. Eldest is driving me to school/work now. I'm sitting in the passenger seat for the first time in a very long time and surprisingly calm.

## Book Reading

* Finished _Words for Pictures_ (2014) by Brian Michael Bendis. Very [minimal notes here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/notes-words-for-pictures-2014/).
* Very little reading in terms of novels this past week.
* This weekâ€™s comic reading: 45 issues. Lots of new stuff still. Probably because as we head into the fall? I picked up Jason Aaron's TMNT. So... basically Raphael as Wolverine with a lot of internal monologuing and badassery, yeah? Did I get that right? Added to the pull list. Also added TMNT: Nightwatcher and TMNT: Mutant Nation. Because why not.
* Absolute Power #3 we start seeing the reversal in the mini-series. Starting to pick up on more of the DC character names? Still think it's absolutely ridiculous and boring. So many ___man, ___woman, ___girl, ___boy, all wearing similar costumes, all in one family. Super, Bat, Cat, Hawk, Aqua, Wonder. It's all so vanilla and conservative. I find myself being drawn to Green Lantern, Black Canary, Oracle, Swamp Thing, and hell, even Black Orchid... partly because of their name, and mostly because I know so little about them and they're not as huge in the public consciousness. I think what got me hooked on Absolute Power #1 as my way as an intro into the DC universe was Amanada Waller. Badass black woman, villain, and just "cool and in control". Couldn't care less about the heroes. As I read more reddit forums to get culturally caught up... DC's good guys are just... _too good_. They are like conservative and upstandingly good. The model citizen of good. Marvel has _flaws_ heroes. That's why it works. But also -- Connor Goldsmith on Cerebro #4 on Storm really clarified it for me. The Avengers are cops. Who wants to read about cops and police? And that's what I get with DC. They're all _actually_ good guys in the sense that they're almost infallible, aspirational, but ultimately, _un_-relatable. These are people I would look up to in REAL LIFE, not in my escapism where I want grounded stories. Weird to say that. That said, I am inching towards buying Gail Simone's run on Wonder Woman and Geoff John's run on Green Lantern because I want to explore this universe more.
* RANDOM FINAL NOTES: So The Power Fantasy lived up to its hype. Didn't really care for the whole X of Swords event. The final issue though, reminding us of the stakes really worked out. I was expecting Aliens vs. Avengers to be stupid. Like dumb, stupid, idiotic fun... but instead I get old-assed Avengers with _gravitas_. WTF. That's what makes Hickman great, I guess. He's got range. Started my third? fourth? attempt of Grant Morrison's _The Invisibles_. Made it past the first two issues this time.
* I sat down to organize my pull list so I could see what's what and it's looking a little absurdly long.
