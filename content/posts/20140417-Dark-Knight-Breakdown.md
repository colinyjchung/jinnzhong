## THOUGHTS:

- Every scene is tight and flows from one to another in a hurried pace.
As soon as one scene ends, you're setting up for the next action.
- There's a lot (A LOT) of smash cutting between three scenes during several sequences
In other words, three scenes are moving concurrently and in parallel, causing tension, urgency and collisions.
- When it does take time to take a breather -- it's this constant uncertainty with what's about to happen.
- Most scenes are 30 seconds to a minute long. It's JUST enough to get the story across so we can move on.
