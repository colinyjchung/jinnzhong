This is probably completely useless, but I was thinking is there a useful cross-section between [plot threads](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/plot-thread/) and the MICE Quotient? As in, are there insights to gather from it?

Looking at the table below, I don't think so. In some cases, the milieu matters a lot more ([adventure](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-adventure/), [horror](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-horror/)). Inquiry seems to only show up heavily in [mystery](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-mystery/), but can show up in [horror](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-horror/), (_why are we being punished? Or what unfinished business does this supernatural thing have?_), [institution](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-institution/), (_who's the power behind the throne? Who's causing all this misery? Who's secretly spying on us?_), and [thriller](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-thriller/), (_who's chasing me? Why was I framed?_).

Looking at character, the obvious ones are [ascension](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-ascension/), [romance](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-romance/) and [drama](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-drama/). Those are all about how characters change and grow, but they need external events to move them or for them to proactively affect, so that's a heavy X too.

Finally, event. Adventure and horror are both heavy on both M & E. As one travels to get a thing and the other is trapped in a house to fight a monster... but both have destablized situations to reach a new status quo. [Institution](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-institution/), [metamorphosis](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-metamorphosis/) and [thriller](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/plot-thread-thriller/) are probably the most event heavy without character... as you _could_ technically have fun, pulpy, mass market stories here without developing characters. But then again, you can do that for adventure, horror, and mystery too.

OK, yeah. This was defintiely NOT A USEFUL EXERCISE.
