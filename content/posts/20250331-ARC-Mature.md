The Mature Arc is where the PROT reaches a new life stage but is not willing to move on yet. New life stages could be breakup/divorce, new adulthood responsibilities, new job/house, marriage, pregnancy, empty nest, death, being asked to "step down" from power. It's stagnancy. Unlike [ARC: Become](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/tags/arc-become/), wherein PROT willingly (or just needs a little nudge) to move forward, the Mature ARC is a story about resistance to the point where, if an escape hatch is offered, they will take it.

These stories are usually about "one last trip", a feat to "prove oneself", or a metamorphosis story where thru magic/science they get to keep their life stagnant, or do the things they always wanted to do but never got to because life got away from them. It's the sad realization that some things were meant to be done in your 20s, 30s, whatever... and trying to do it, refusing to move on, is actually toxic and hurts the people you love. In other words, yes, there are some things in life where it _can_ be too late to do.

This is a POSITIVE ARC if after all PROT's hijinks and histrionics, they learn to move on. Otherwise, it's a NEGATIVE ARC where characters stay horrible.


## The Emotional Arc

* **STS**: _I'm not where I thought I'd be in life and now I have to deal with this too?!_
* **DSR**: [metamorphosis/escape]] _Hurray! I can put it off and live the life I really want!_
* **BWO**: _YOLO! This is what I've always wanted! I'm going after it! I rule!_
* **PNR**: _oh. I think I'm hurting people I love by avoiding/deferring/evading._
* **AIL**: _My shenanigans might've ruined my real relationships irreparably. Don't leave me!_
* **CMX**: _I was wrong. I will fix this. I now know what I need was always in front of me._

_alt. CMX_: PROT stays in their transformed state, runs away forever. Never moves on.

## The Stakes

* Giving up on "dreams" you never worked on
* Refusing to believe it's "too late" to pursue certain goals.
* Holding on to your current life stage for just a few more moments

## The Triangle(s)

* PROT: The Avoidant
* Friends and Family they _already_ have and NEED versus...
* New Friends who represent an escape, side quest, or "one last chance to" do X
* A RIVAL who did what the PROT wanted to do (whose purpose is to show how it's not greener on the other side).
