**Based on**: _My Dead_ by Peter Orner - [source](https://www.newyorker.com/books/flash-fiction/my-dead)

1. POV meets someone and they randomly/spontaneously decide to go to an event/ritual/game together.
2. They get there, the event is weird and slightly disappointing. It ends in a whimper.
3. On the way home a near-accident happens and POV acts in a cowardly way.
