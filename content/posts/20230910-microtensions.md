**Microtension** Moment by moment tension - constant state of suspense. Not central conflict, not stakes of the scene, not merely action.

Microtension = Conflicting Emotions

## PARTS OF FICTION
* Setting
* Travel
* Description
* Exposition
* Backstory
* Dialogue
* Aftermath
* Action
* Interior

## HOW TO INSERT MICROTENSION TO EACH PART

**Dialogue/Exposition** (Explaining complex systems, technical jargon, interwoven relationships, past history... which could be a dull info-dump).
* Conversation partner doubts the facts, skeptical of it, accuses them of lying. Question isn't whether they'll settle the logic, but will debators reconcile?
* Inner conflict of POV character. Should they defend the accusations? Should they reveal this info at this time? What harm or who will this hurt if they reveal it?
* Friendly disagreement between allies. Disagree on methods, values, choices, how to go about things, who to talk to, the order of operations.

**Action/Violence/Sex** (if stricly visual, flat. Objective description is boring, you must insert micro-tension).
* Disbelief at what's in front of them
* Deciding to reveal/admit/confess/accept/reject something during the action and struggling with it until action is complete and they decide.
* Indecision, guilt, or shame about something they don't want to deal with during this action sequence. Fear of consequences if revealed.

**Interior POV/Emotion** (don't reiterate what reader already felt/thought. Show conflicting emotions).
* Unique POV of a specialist/expert in action and what they consider, why, how they weigh their decisions.
* Conflicting emotions about an accomplishment. Doubt about a success, anxiety over a decision where results are not in yet 
* Uncertainty/indecision over difficult choices
* Insecurity at inadequecy
* Struggling between anger & forgiveness, feelings vs doing "the right thing", holding on vs. letting go. Dilemmas. Opposing impulses.

**Setting/Travel/Description**. Don't linger on this unless...
* Seed doubt of the setting via an unreliable narrator
* Metaphor for characters' flaws: ego, fear, insecurities, anxieties, worries, judgment.
* Have character offer their opinion, thoughts, memories, observations, and emotions on the place... how their eyes color what they see

**Backstory**. Do it as it's relevant to the plot via a struggle of conflicting emotions about the subject. Create inner tension

**Aftermath**. Cut if you can. If you keep it, you better have a difficult decision or conflicting emotions about what just happened that agonizes your POV character over what to do next.

**Foreshadowing**. Anticipation, shift of emotion,
