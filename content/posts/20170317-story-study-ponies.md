## SCENE ONE (373)
Barbara is looking at an invitation to a “cutting-out party” with “TheOtherGirls” so she can hang out with them. Sunny is her pony. It talks. She says she can’t wait to have friends. Barbara asks her if she knows what she wants to keep. She want to talk. So she’ll lose her wings and horns. WORLD BUILD EXPLANATION: All ponies have voice, wings and horns. Then they go to a cutting-out party and lose two of three… in order to fit in with TheOtherGirls. Barbara looks at their ponies outside classroom windows.

## SCENE TWO (512)
The part is at TopGirl’s house. TopGirl says her pony is not as pretty as Starblossom. There are girls inside and outside playing games. And then it’s time. TopGirl asks Barbara what Sunny picked. TopGirl gives Barbara the curved knife. She’s surprised she has to do it and not some grown-up. Wings come off easy, and blood smells like cotton candy. She throws up. The horn is harder. More cotton-candy blood. Barbara cries.

## TURN (300)
But Starblossom pushes the knife forward and TopGirl says you have to cut off the horn too. But I already did two out of three! But that’s only to become OneOfUs. The ponies choose their friends too and that costs. Barbara refuses. Sunny runs. the other ponies chase her. Sunny can’t run because she has no more wings. They surround her and stomp on her until there’s nothing. 

## RESOLUTION (69)
TopGirl asks the others if they’d like cookies and go back to the house. Barbara follows. She asks them what they’re playing. They say why are you here? You don’t have a pony.
