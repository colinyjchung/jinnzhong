## Highlights This Week

* Started my new job. It's weird to say that. But this is a full-time contract and that's basically a job. I haven't had a full-time job in 15 years since eBay. And this really has been the brunt of what I did this week. I mean, there were also a lot of significant things I'll talk about under 4000 weeks that bore the same emotional weight, but time-wise this is most of it.
* With that said -- fiction writing was severely sacrificed this past week. I think there's going to be some time to adjust and adapt to the new homeostasis.
* So C-Chord went to their first rock concert on Monday. We saw Laufey at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. That was quite the experience. Grace Enger opened. And on Saturday, I burnt through _Money Heist P5_ (2021). I feel so empty now that it's all over.

## EOW Time Tracking

The following is based on logged productive hours using [Timeular](https://timeular.com/?linkId=lp_182779&sourceId=colin-yj-chung&tenantId=timeular). Parameters and definitions in footnote[^2].

| TYPE | % | BAR |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **F** | 4% | <div style="width:100px;height:15px;background:#AAAAAA;border:1.3px solid #000000;"><div style="width:4%;height:14px;background:#0492C2;font-size:12px; color:white; line-height:12px;"></div></div> |
| **X** | 2% | <div style="width:100px;height:15px;background:#AAAAAA;border:1.3px solid #000000;"><div style="width:2%;height:14px;background:#BC544B;font-size:12px; color:white; line-height:12px;"></div></div> |
| **C** | 82% |<div style="width:100px;height:15px;background:#AAAAAA;border:1.3px solid #000000;"><div style="width:82%;height:14px;background:#48AAAD;font-size:12px; color:white; line-height:12px;"></div></div> |

Not surprised by the steep precipitous drop in all things fiction. And as I wrote last week, perhaps tracking it like this isn't helpful or useful anymore as my new role is essentially a full-time position and not a wobbly timey-wimey freelancing kind of life. I just don't have energy to change the format yet. I'm thinking simply tracking if I put in the reps daily is a lot more useful indicator (a leading indicator, if you will) of whether I'm pushing fiction forward.

## Four Thousand Weeks

So last week I was beat because I was hustling and trying to land this job. This week I'm beat because it was the first week of onboarding, training, and basically 7-8 hours of Zoom each day. And I know I shouldn't beat myself up for not being able to move fiction forward. Like logically and rationally I know that. I just made some significant changes in my life. I get that. And also - let's not forget that some unsettling revelations came out of another business interest, and ALSO, I'm pretty sure a two-decade friendship has just effectively ended, and yes, it's been a very busy week, juggling new job, my one last retainer, and handling Zooms scheduled from a while back... But I'm still bothered. Rationally I know this is insane. Raionally, I know I have unrealistic expectations here.

## Book Reading

* The game with Mary Beard's _SPQR_ (2015) right now is "will I finish it?" (as I'm at the 81% mark as I write this) in time for the Tuesday return date. I really think after a couple more books, I'm going to drop Libby/Library audiobooks and move over to Libro.fm. Libby/Library did its job. It introduced me to the world of audiobooks. I don't need to keep playing their game.
* Finally crossed the 70-75% mark of _Pride and Prejudice_. Lydia eloped (or, more accurately was groomed and kidnapped, then held hostage for ransom... oh hey, maybe some idiot on the far-right will eventually realize this and put it on the banned book list, but we all know they don't read, including the bible).
* Started my re-read of Kazuo Ishiguro's _Never Let Me Go_ (2005) because my eldest is writing an essay on it and I've been tasked by the wife to help.

[^1]: LEGEND for **Project Status Dashboard**

    * **prj** = project codename
    * **st** = start date
    * **dr** = 1st draft completed
    * **ed** = edits (before beta/crits) completed
    * **rv** = revisions (post-feedback) completed
    * **fn** = story (or chapter) finished

[^2]: The most important objective of the **EOW Time Tracking** is to ensure that productive hours _are_ dedicated to actual fiction writing. This is to prevent excuses, distractions, and procrastination activities like... Using "I'm too busy with client work" as an excuse or doing unnecessary "fiction-related" activities (like consuming more craft education, excessive world-building research, and working on marketing stuff when I'm not even published yet!)
    
    LEGEND for **EOW Time Tracking**
    * F = Actual fiction writing work (drafting, editing).
    * X = Activities related to fiction, but not actual writing!
    * C = Paid client work.
    * P = Business related work.
