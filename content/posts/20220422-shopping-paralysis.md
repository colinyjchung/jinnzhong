RN sent over a $300 Amazon GC this morning and it threw me for a loop. I've been feeling this way the last several months where the concept of shopping for "fun items" throws me into an existential loop. 

I spent a lot of December of 2021 shopping for wargames and realizing I had absolutely no time nor energy for any of it. I look at my three boxes of miniatures and it's just absurd. I have reached a point in my life where I can fulfill any of my childhood dreams - miniatures, Hero Quest, roleplaying games -- but with the monkey's paw realization that I have absolutely no time for any of it.

[REDACTED]: Reflection on business gains based on the insane overload of working three retainers, launching a business, one partner doing really well, and another requiring a "we need to talk" conversation.

But back to this morning. It got me reflecitng on what I would spend $300 on. And the question is interesting. Do I want to spend it on board games I won't play? No. How about books which I have hundreds of I haven't read? No. Another RPG book? Lego? No. No. Miniatures? Definitely not. Toys to represent my identity? NO.

What I need is time/energy to focus on things that will move me out of freelancing and into a career/business that needs less of my time and pays me 10X more. But more improtantly, I need to think hard about my life projects. The ones that will leave a creative legacy.
