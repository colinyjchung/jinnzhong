Cathie wore a black shawl, knee-high heeled leather boots, and crimson lipstick. Cathie is thirty-three and it isn’t until she walks down twenty-third street browsing for used fantasy that she realizes the way she has dressed. Upon that thought, her dress started reeking in her mind of sulfur and brimstone and black smoke. Embarrassed, she excuses herself from her morning ritual and goes home empty handed.
