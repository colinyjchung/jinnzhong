**Based on**: _The Hartleys_ by John Cheever - source: _Cheever: Collected Stories and Other Writings_ (2009).

1. POV and group arrive at PLACE of past significance to do an activity. One chooses not to participate.
2. POV and non-participant have a meal. POV has an argument with another in the group about non-participant or something else.
3. POV keeps forcing activities and together time with arguer until REVEAL: nobody wants to be here except POV, who is trying to "fix things".
4. The non-participant trues the activity out of guilt, love, loyalty, need to impress POV, whatever... but fails, gets hurt, or dies in trying. POV regrets everything.
