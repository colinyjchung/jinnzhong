Characters, situations, and systems/games where it's not as they seem.

## Not As They Seem
* They act sweet and innocent but they're really evil
* They act violent and irrational, but they just need a little love and attention
* They riddle and confuse, but just need a simple answer
* They have questionable morals and ethics, but they're doing it for overall good
* They have this complex distracting behavior, but a "trick answer" (don't answer) is what they want
* They act in ways to show that the system is broken
