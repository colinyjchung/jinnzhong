The following are thoughts and reactions I had _while_ reading _The Final Empire_ (2006) by Brandon Sanderson. They do not reflect my overall post-reading opinion of the work. 

:warning: **SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD** (_obviously_). :warning:

* the prose is so functional, workmanlike, and generic. I am listening to this at 2.5X and not missing a beat.
* Oh, so this is like the predecessor to Locke Lamora then? You got your smug unflappable hero leading a crew to mess with the nobles. Except the story is far superior here
* There are so many stand up and cheer moments. Can’t help but like Vin.
* Chapter 17. Ok. I teared up on Kezior’s backstory.
* 85%. They killed Marsh.
