The _Weird Loner Club_ (2015-2020) was a book club I started to focus on "heavy books". That is, dense, difficult books on politics, history, science, religion, economics, biographies, and the like. My initial proposal email to JH, LB, and X can be [found here](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/heavy-book-club-proposal/). Basically, we'd rotate picking the books and every four weeks, we'd jump on a conference line (back in the days of yore pre-Zoom), and discuss the book we'd just read.

We eventually had to kick X out due to a business deal gone wrong (he ghosted on a contract and he's X because he doesn't even deserve an initial for what he did, costing me tens of thousands in business), and then LB went back to school to get a MBA, at which point, I reached out to some new blood with a revised [invitation email](https://journal.jinnzhong.com/heavy-book-club-invitation/). 

Four of the new invites didn't last very long. One had a business that took off, two just couldn't see themselves doing this after one book, and a third one kept picking the most boring books _and_ never showed up for the calls... leaving the disgruntled remainder to discuss a book we all hated and grousing at the fact the person who picked the book wasn't even in attendance.

That said, the new group thrived with JH, L, R, T, and OH from mid-2016 onwards. That was, until 2020. Near the end of the book club's life, we had a string of books that everyone ranked low and we were simply tired of reading books that were a slog. Despite a valiant attempt to save the club (with a fancy nomination and vetoing system, all designed in an eleventh hour frenzy), quarantine happened, and it sort of ended up becoming a excuse to let the book club die. The last few planned books are strong though. I intend to read them still. And look, as I write this (2024-01-04), our last planned book became a Scorcese film with Leo.

## Some Random Bits

* For some reason, there were a few books the _Weird Loner Club_ picked where the author died shortly after we picked their book. Obviously, correlation isn't causation. But you _could_ argue that we killed Herman Wouk.
* The name _Weird Loner Club_ came about when OH was having a difficult, stressful day, and she wasn't going to attend the call, but then her wife told her, "Look, you always feel better after talking to those weird loners on that book club of yours." The name stuck.
* My god, some of those books we slogged through and hate-read were truly, utterly horrible. But there were some shining gems as well. Without wading through the spreadsheet below, here were books that scored an average of 4.5 and above (discounting average scores with less than three rankings):
   * _Dying Every Day_ (2014) by James Romm, selected by JH
   * _A People's History of the United States_ (1980) by Howard Zinn, selected by yours truly
   * _Open_ (2009) by Andre Agassi, selected by JH
   * _Alexander Hamilton_ (2004) by	Ron Chernow, selected by OH
   * _Debt: The First 5000 Years_ by David Graeber, selected by OH
   * _A Thousand Naked Strangers_ (2016) by Kevin Hazzard, selected by R
   * _Bad Blood_ (2018)	by John Carreyrou, selected by T
   * _Circe_ (2018) by Madeline Miller, selected by OH

So had this been a game on who picks the best books, the winner is clearly OH.
